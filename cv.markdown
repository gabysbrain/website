Computer scientist who's
worked on both greenfield projects and existing systems. 
I also have worked as a computer science researcher, 
I specialize in developing methods
to link visualization with sensitivity and uncertainty analysis to help
people understand complex machine learning and simulation models.
I love learning about new technologies and how I can use them to
create better software more easily.

    * Refactored critical data ingestion services improving reliability,
          testability, and maintainability. Legacy versions of services were
          convoluted and inconsistent. Also worked with stakeholders to create
          specifications (none existed before)
    * Led the project to institute distributed tracing across all 
          importers using Sentry.

September 2007 -- June 2010

    * Implemented an investment management system for a variety of asset types
      using Pylons/Python, the Dojo javascript framework, and PostgreSQL.
    * Specified and supervised the integration of the Alfresco document 
      management system with the investment management system to track key 
      investment decisions and deal documents.
    * Designed a GIS system for monitoring areas of the country risky to banks.
    * Built a genetic algorithm to find the optimal method to perform field 
      visits across the country.
    * Used the Condor grid service to implement a CDO evaluation system that 
      enabled a Unix server to call a Windows-only application.
    * Wrote a simple web crawler to download rural newspaper articles to 
      a central data store so analysts could browse regional news not covered 
      by the major news aggregation sites.

July 2004 -- September 2007
: **Vice President, Lead Developer** Bear Stearns Asset Management. New York, NY

    * Supervised a team of 4 to design and implement a front-office 
      portfolio surveillance system for a structured finance hedge fund 
      using a SQL database using Java and Ruby on Rails.
    * Used Condor to parallelize various long-running tasks across multiple 
      compute nodes.
    * Assisted with the design and implementation of a proprietary credit 
      risk model for an internally managed fund.
    * Interacted directly with business staff to design and implement 
      a variety of portfolio management systems.

March 2003 -- July 2004
: **Senior Associate** Moody's Investors Service. New York, NY 

    * Implemented a spread-based Monte Carlo asset simulation in C.
    * Created a combination Excel spreadsheet and C to create an Excel 
      add-in to rate combo notes.
    * Assisted analysts with modeling complex waterfall steps in CDO Analytics.
    * Assisted with the coordination of the CDO Analytics testing team.
    * Wrote specifications based on analysts' suggestions and work flow.
