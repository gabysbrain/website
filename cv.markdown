Computer scientist with extensive experience building systems from the ground
up as well as research in ML/AI with a focus on visual analysis in
multi-dimensional continuous spaces and understanding complex models. I also
dabble in functional programming. 
I love learning about new technologies and how I can use them to
create better software more easily.
I am particularly
a fan of the Haskell and 
PureScript languages.
