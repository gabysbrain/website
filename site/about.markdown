# About me

![](/images/me.jpg)

I am a Lecturer at Swansea University.  I study
how visualization and statistical methods can be used to help scientists
understand and create better computer models.

I try to spend as much time in the outdoors as possible. I love skiing,
hiking, climbing, and scuba diving.  I have also been known to run or bike
occasionally.

My email address is [t.d.torsney-weir@swansea.ac.uk](mailto:t.d.torsney-weir@swansea.ac.uk)

I can also be found
as "gabysbrain" on
[Github](<%= data.social.github %>).
