# About me

![](/images/me.jpg)

I am a PhD student at the University of Vienna in Austria.  I study how
visualization and statistical methods can be used to help scientists
understand and create better computer models.

I try to spend as much time in the outdoors as possible. I love skiing,
hiking, climbing, and scuba diving.  I have also been known to run or bike
occasionally.

My email address is [thomas.torsney-weir@univie.ac.at](mailto:thomas.torsney-weir@univie.ac.at)

I can also be found
as "gabysbrain" on
[Github](<%= data.social.github %>).
