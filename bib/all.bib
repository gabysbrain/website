  abstract = {Linguists use annotated text collections to validate, refute and refine a hypothesis about the written language. This research requires the creation and analysis of complex queries which are often above the technical expertise of the domain users. In this paper, we present a tool-design which enables language researchers to easily query annotated text corpora and conduct a comparative multi-faceted analysis on a single screen. The results of the iterative design process, including requirement analysis, multiple prototyping and user evaluation sessions, and expert reviews, are documented in detail. Our tool, called CorpSum, shows a 43.12 point increase in the mean SUS score in a randomized within-subjects test and an improvement of 3.18 times in mean task completion duration compared to a conventional solution. Two detailed case studies with linguists demonstrate a significant improvement for solving the real-world problems of the domain users.},

  abstract = {We report on an ongoing collaboration between epidemiological modellers and visualization researchers by documenting and reflecting upon knowledge constructs -- a series of ideas, approaches and methods taken from existing visualization research and practice -- deployed and developed to support modelling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Structured independent commentary on these efforts is synthesized through iterative reflection to develop: evidence of the effectiveness and value of visualization in this context; open problems upon which the research communities may focus; guidance for future activity of this type; and recommendations to safeguard the achievements and promote, advance, secure and prepare for future collaborations of this kind. In describing and comparing a series of related projects that were undertaken in unprecedented conditions, our hope is that this unique report, and its rich interactive supplementary materials, will guide the scientific community in embracing visualization in its observation, analysis and modelling of data as well as in disseminating findings. Equally we hope to encourage the visualization community to engage with impactful science in addressing its emerging data challenges. If we are successful, this showcase of activity may stimulate mutually beneficial engagement between communities with complementary expertise to address problems of significance in epidemiology and beyond. https://ramp-vis.github.io/RAMPVIS-PhilTransA-Supplement/},

  abstract = {A common strategy in Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) is to rank alternative solutions by weighted summary scores. Weights, however, are often abstract to the decision maker and can only be set by vague intuition. While previous work supports a point-wise exploration of weight spaces, we argue that MCDM can benefit from a regional and global visual analysis of weight spaces. Our main contribution is WeightLifter, a novel interactive visualization technique for weight-based MCDM that facilitates the exploration of weight spaces with up to ten criteria. Our technique enables users to better understand the sensitivity of a decision to changes of weights, to efficiently localize weight regions where a given solution ranks high, and to filter out solutions which do not rank high enough for any plausible combination of weights. We provide a comprehensive requirement analysis for weight-based MCDM and describe an interactive workflow that meets these requirements. For evaluation, we describe a usage scenario of WeightLifter in automotive engineering and report qualitative feedback from users of a deployed version as well as preliminary feedback from decision makers in multiple domains. This feedback confirms that WeightLifter increases both the efficiency of weight-based MCDM and the awareness of uncertainty in the ultimate decisions.},

We designed cellPACKexplorer with a flexible interface to support both types of users. We evaluated our tool through case studies and questionnaires. Novice users were able to create cell models with cellPACK and explore the behavior of different parameters. Further, expert users discovered an error in the code and were able to locate the problem quickly with our new analysis tool. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of our findings in the wider visualization community.},

  abstract = {We present a system called Tuner to systematically analyze the parameter space of com- plex computer simulations, which are time consuming to run and consequently cannot be exhaustively sampled. We begin with a sparse initial sampling of the parameter space, then use these samples to create a fast emulator of the simulation. Analyzing this emulator gives the user insight on further sampling the simulation. Tuner guides the user through sampling and provides tools to find optimal parameter settings of up to two objective functions and perform sensitivity analysis. We present use-cases from the domain of image segmentation algorithms. Since our method must utilize samples of the simulation and relies on an inherently interactive visualization method, we perform a complexity analysis to see how many sam- ples can be rendered while staying interactive. We examined how rendering performance changes with the dimensionality, reconstruction kernel size, and number of sample points. To study this, we decomposed the rendering complexity into a predictive cost function that combines the cost of filtering each data point and then the cost to draw each pixel on screen. This cost function is calibrated to the time to filter and draw for two different hardware configurations. The cost formulation is used to examine the effects on rendering time from using box filtering versus a radial distance measure in high-dimensional data spaces as used for the filtered scatterplot and HyperSlice visualization methods, respectively. We find that for a constant kernel volume, rendering performance increases with dimensionality in the HyperSlice technique while it decreases with the filtered scatterplot technique. We also find that the total number of sample points and not the size of the reconstruction kernel is a much stronger determinant of the rendering time.},
