  volume = {8},
  issn = {1077-2626},
  abstract = {In the last several years, large multidimensional databases have become common in a variety of applications, such as data warehousing and scientific computing. Analysis and exploration tasks place significant demands on the interfaces to these databases. Because of the size of the data sets, dense graphical representations are more effective for exploration than spreadsheets and charts. Furthermore, because of the exploratory nature of the analysis, it must be possible for the analysts to change visualizations rapidly as they pursue a cycle involving first hypothesis and then experimentation. In this paper, we present Polaris, an interface for exploring large multidimensional databases that extends the well-known pivot table interface. The novel features of Polaris include an interface for constructing visual specifications of table-based graphical displays and the ability to generate a precise set of relational queries from the visual specifications. The visual specifications can be rapidly and incrementally developed, giving the analyst visual feedback as he constructs complex queries and visualizations},

  volume = {27},

  abstract = {Feature selection is an important problem for pattern classification systems. We study how to select good features according to the maximal statistical dependency criterion based on mutual information. Because of the difficulty in directly implementing the maximal dependency condition, we first derive an equivalent form, called minimal-redundancy-maximal-relevance criterion (mRMR), for first-order incremental feature selection. Then, we present a two-stage feature selection algorithm by combining mRMR and other more sophisticated feature selectors (e.g., wrappers). This allows us to select a compact set of superior features at very low cost. We perform extensive experimental comparison of our algorithm and other methods using three different classifiers (naive Bayes, support vector machine, and linear discriminate analysis) and four different data sets (handwritten digits, arrhythmia, NCI cancer cell lines, and lymphoma tissues). The results confirm that mRMR leads to promising improvement on feature selection and classification accuracy.},

  title = {Binary \{\vphantom\}{{PSO}}\vphantom\{\} with Mutation Operator for Feature Selection Using Decision Tree Applied to Spam Detection},
  volume = {64},
  issn = {0950-7051},
  abstract = {Abstract In this paper, we proposed a novel spam detection method that focused on reducing the false positive error of mislabeling nonspam as spam. First, we used the wrapper-based feature selection method to extract crucial features. Second, the decision tree was chosen as the classifier model with C4.5 as the training algorithm. Third, the cost matrix was introduced to give different weights to two error types, i.e., the false positive and the false negative errors. We define the weight parameter as {$\alpha$} to adjust the relative importance of the two error types. Fourth, K-fold cross validation was employed to reduce out-of-sample error. Finally, the binary \{PSO\} with mutation operator (MBPSO) was used as the subset search strategy. Our experimental dataset contains 6000 emails, which were collected during the year of 2012. We conducted a Kolmogorov\textendash{}Smirnov hypothesis test on the capital-run-length related features and found that all the p values were less than 0.001. Afterwards, we found {$\alpha$} = 7 was the most appropriate in our model. Among seven meta-heuristic algorithms, we demonstrated the \{MBPSO\} is superior to GA, RSA, PSO, and \{BPSO\} in terms of classification performance. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the decision tree with feature selection by \{MBPSO\} were 91.02\%, 97.51\%, and 94.27\%, respectively. We also compared the \{MBPSO\} with conventional feature selection methods such as \{SFS\} and SBS. The results showed that the \{MBPSO\} performs better than \{SFS\} and SBS. We also demonstrated that wrappers are more effective than filters with regard to classification performance indexes. It was clearly shown that the proposed method is effective, and it can reduce the false positive error without compromising the sensitivity and accuracy values.},

This tool helps users understand complex machine learning architectures by visualizing their underlying dataflow graphs. The tool works by applying a series of graph transformations that enable standard layout techniques to produce a legible interactive diagram. To declutter the graph, we decouple non-critical nodes from the layout. To provide an overview, we build a clustered graph using the hierarchical structure annotated in the source code. To support exploration of nested structure on demand, we perform edge bundling to enable stable and responsive cluster expansion. Finally, we detect and highlight repeated structures to emphasize a model's modular composition. To demonstrate the utility of the visualizer, we describe example usage scenarios and report user feedback. Overall, users find the visualizer useful for understanding, debugging, and sharing the structures of their models.},

  volume = {PP},

  abstract = {Balancing accuracy gains with other objectives such as interpretability is a key challenge when building decision trees. However, this process is difficult to automate because it involves know-how about the domain as well as the purpose of the model. This paper presents TreePOD, a new approach for sensitivity-aware model selection along trade-offs. TreePOD is based on exploring a large set of candidate trees generated by sampling the parameters of tree construction algorithms. Based on this set, visualizations of quantitative and qualitative tree aspects provide a comprehensive overview of possible tree characteristics. Along trade-offs between two objectives, TreePOD provides efficient selection guidance by focusing on Pareto-optimal tree candidates. TreePOD also conveys the sensitivities of tree characteristics on variations of selected parameters by extending the tree generation process with a full-factorial sampling. We demonstrate how TreePOD supports a variety of tasks involved in decision tree selection and describe its integration in a holistic workflow for building and selecting decision trees. For evaluation, we illustrate a case study for predicting critical power grid states, and we report qualitative feedback from domain experts in the energy sector. This feedback suggests that TreePOD enables users with and without statistical background a confident and efficient identification of suitable decision trees.},

For instance, we show that when graphs are bigger than twenty vertices, the matrix-based visualization performs better than node-link diagrams on most tasks.

  abstract = {AlphaGo has demonstrated that a machine can learn how to do things that people spend many years of concentrated study learning, and it can rapidly learn how to do them better than any human can. Caliskan et al. now show that machines can learn word associations from written texts and that these associations mirror those learned by humans, as measured by the Implicit Association Test (IAT) (see the Perspective by Greenwald). Why does this matter? Because the IAT has predictive value in uncovering the association between concepts, such as pleasantness and flowers or unpleasantness and insects. It can also tease out attitudes and beliefs\textemdash{}for example, associations between female names and family or male names and career. Such biases may not be expressed explicitly, yet they can prove influential in behavior.Science, this issue p. 183; see also p. 133Machine learning is a means to derive artificial intelligence by discovering patterns in existing data. Here, we show that applying machine learning to ordinary human language results in human-like semantic biases. We replicated a spectrum of known biases, as measured by the Implicit Association Test, using a widely used, purely statistical machine-learning model trained on a standard corpus of text from the World Wide Web. Our results indicate that text corpora contain recoverable and accurate imprints of our historic biases, whether morally neutral as toward insects or flowers, problematic as toward race or gender, or even simply veridical, reflecting the status quo distribution of gender with respect to careers or first names. Our methods hold promise for identifying and addressing sources of bias in culture, including technology.},

  abstract = {We study economic growth and inflation at different levels of government and external debt. Our analysis is based on new data on forty-four countries spanning about two hundred years. The dataset incorporates over 3,700 annual observations covering a wide range of political systems, institutions, exchange rate arrangements, and historic circumstances. Our main findings are: First, the relationship between government debt and real GDP growth is weak for debt/GDP ratios below a threshold of 90 percent of GDP. Above 90 percent, median growth rates fall by one percent, and average growth falls considerably more. We find that the threshold for public debt is similar in advanced and emerging economies. Second, emerging markets face lower thresholds for external debt (public and private)\textendash{}which is usually denominated in a foreign currency. When external debt reaches 60 percent of GDP, annual growth declines by about two percent; for higher levels, growth rates are roughly cut in half. Third, there is no apparent contemporaneous link between inflation and public debt levels for the advanced countries as a group (some countries, such as the United States, have experienced higher inflation when debt/GDP is high.) The story is entirely different for emerging markets, where inflation rises sharply as debt increases.},

  title = {Overcoming {{Algorithm Aversion}}: {{People Will Use Imperfect Algorithms If They Can}} ({{Even Slightly}}) {{Modify Them}}},
  abstract = {Although evidence-based algorithms consistently outperform human forecasters, people often fail to use them after learning that they are imperfect, a phenomenon known as algorithm aversion. In this paper, we present three studies investigating how to reduce algorithm aversion. In incentivized forecasting tasks, participants chose between using their own forecasts or those of an algorithm that was built by experts. Participants were considerably more likely to choose to use an imperfect algorithm when they could modify its forecasts, and they performed better as a result. Notably, the preference for modifiable algorithms held even when participants were severely restricted in the modifications they could make (Studies 1\textendash{}3). In fact, our results suggest that participants' preference for modifiable algorithms was indicative of a desire for some control over the forecasting outcome, and not for a desire for greater control over the forecasting outcome, as participants' preference for modifiable algorithms was relatively insensitive to the magnitude of the modifications they were able to make (Study 2). Additionally, we found that giving participants the freedom to modify an imperfect algorithm made them feel more satisfied with the forecasting process, more likely to believe that the algorithm was superior, and more likely to choose to use an algorithm to make subsequent forecasts (Study 3). This research suggests that one can reduce algorithm aversion by giving people some control\textemdash{}even a slight amount\textemdash{}over an imperfect algorithm's forecast.

  abstract = {This system paper presents the Topology ToolKit (TTK), a software platform designed for the topological analysis of scalar data in scientific visualization. While topological data analysis has gained in popularity over the last two decades, it has not yet been widely adopted as a standard data analysis tool for end users or developers. TTK aims at addressing this problem by providing a unified, generic, efficient, and robust implementation of key algorithms for the topological analysis of scalar data, including: critical points, integral lines, persistence diagrams, persistence curves, merge trees, contour trees, Morse-Smale complexes, fiber surfaces, continuous scatterplots, Jacobi sets, Reeb spaces, and more. TTK is easily accessible to end users due to a tight integration with ParaView. It is also easily accessible to developers through a variety of bindings (Python, VTK/C++) for fast prototyping or through direct, dependency-free, C++, to ease integration into pre-existing complex systems. While developing TTK, we faced several algorithmic and software engineering challenges, which we document in this paper. In particular, we present an algorithm for the construction of a discrete gradient that complies to the critical points extracted in the piecewise-linear setting. This algorithm guarantees a combinatorial consistency across the topological abstractions supported by TTK, and importantly, a unified implementation of topological data simplification for multi-scale exploration and analysis. We also present a cached triangulation data structure, that supports time efficient and generic traversals, which self-adjusts its memory usage on demand for input simplicial meshes and which implicitly emulates a triangulation for regular grids with no memory overhead. Finally, we describe an original software architecture, which guarantees memory efficient and direct accesses to TTK features, while still allowing for researchers powerful and easy bindings and extensions. T- K is open source (BSD license) and its code, online documentation and video tutorials are available on TTK's website [108].},

  abstract = {In many real-world optimization problems, a solution cannot be realized in practice exactly as computed, e.g., it may be impossible to produce a board of exactly 3.546 mm width. Whenever computed solutions are not realized exactly but in a perturbed way, we speak of decision uncertainty. We study decision uncertainty in multiobjective optimization problems and we propose the concept of decision robust efficiency for evaluating the robustness of a solution in this case. This solution concept is defined by using the framework of set-valued maps. We prove that convexity and continuity are preserved by the resulting set-valued maps. Moreover, we obtain specific results for particular classes of objective functions that are relevant for solving the set-valued problem. We furthermore prove that decision robust efficient solutions can be found by solving a deterministic problem in case of linear objective functions. We also investigate the relationship of the proposed concept to other concepts in the literature.},

First, we show that despite empirical psychologists' nominal endorsement of a low rate of false-positive findings ({$\leq$} .05), flexibility in data collection, analysis, and reporting dramatically increases actual false-positive rates. In many cases, a researcher is more likely to falsely find evidence that an effect exists than to correctly find evidence that it does not. We present computer simulations and a pair of actual experiments that demonstrate how unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant evidence for a false hypothesis. Second, we suggest a simple, low-cost, and straightforwardly effective disclosure-based solution to this problem. The solution involves six concrete requirements for authors and four guidelines for reviewers, all of which impose a minimal burden on the publication process.},

  volume = {25},

  abstract = {This study presents a new interactive procedure for supporting Decision Makers (DMs) in environmental planning problems involving large, process-based, dynamic models and many (more than two) conflicting objectives. Because of such features of the model, computationally-onerous simulations are the only feasible way of analysis, while the multi-objective nature of the problem entails the combined use of optimization techniques and appropriate tools for the visualization of the associated Pareto frontier. The procedure proposed is based on the iterative improvement of the current best compromise alternative based on interactions with the DM. At each iteration, the DM is informed about the Pareto frontier of a local multi-objective optimization problem, which is generated by linearizing the response surfaces that describe the objectives and constraints of the original planning problem. Interactive visualization of the multi-dimensional Pareto frontier is used to support the DM in choosing the new best compromise alternative. The procedure terminates when the DM is fully satisfied with the current best compromise alternative. The approach is demonstrated in Googong Reservoir (Australia), which is periodically affected by high concentrations of Manganese and Cyanobacteria. Results indicate that substantial improvements could be observed by simply changing the location of the two mixers installed in 2007 and adding another pair of mixers.},

  abstract = {Trade-off information related to Pareto optimal solutions is important in multiobjective optimization problems with conflicting objectives. Recently, the concept of trade-off directions has been introduced for convex problems. These trade-offs are characterized with the help of tangent cones. Generalized trade-off directions for nonconvex problems can be defined by replacing convex tangent cones with nonconvex contingent cones. Here we study how the convex concepts and results can be generalized into a nonconvex case. Giving up convexity naturally means that we need local instead of global analysis.},

  abstract = {Scientists working with large volumes of high-dimensional data, such as global climate patterns, stellar spectra, or human gene distributions, regularly confront the problem of dimensionality reduction: finding meaningful low-dimensional structures hidden in their high-dimensional observations. The human brain confronts the same problem in everyday perception, extracting from its high-dimensional sensory inputs\textemdash{}30,000 auditory nerve fibers or 106 optic nerve fibers\textemdash{}a manageably small number of perceptually relevant features. Here we describe an approach to solving dimensionality reduction problems that uses easily measured local metric information to learn the underlying global geometry of a data set. Unlike classical techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and multidimensional scaling (MDS), our approach is capable of discovering the nonlinear degrees of freedom that underlie complex natural observations, such as human handwriting or images of a face under different viewing conditions. In contrast to previous algorithms for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, ours efficiently computes a globally optimal solution, and, for an important class of data manifolds, is guaranteed to converge asymptotically to the true structure.},

Such a grammar allows us to move beyond named graphics (e.g., the ``scatterplot'') and gain insight into the deep structure that underlies statistical graphics. This article builds on Wilkinson, Anand, and Grossman (2005), describing extensions and refinements developed while building an open source implementation of the grammar of graphics for R, ggplot2. The topics in this article include an introduction to the grammar by working through the process of creating a plot, and discussing the components that we need. The grammar is then presented formally and compared to Wilkinson's grammar, highlighting the hierarchy of defaults, and the implications of embedding a graphical grammar into a programming language. The power of the grammar is illustrated with a selection of examples that explore different components and their interactions, in more detail. The article concludes by discussing some perceptual issues, and thinking about how we can build on the grammar to learn how to create graphical ``poems.''

This is not so foreign to us since we, when traveling, also experience the world in a serial fashion. But we typically have access to a map to help with positioning, orientation, navigation, and trip planning. Here, we propose a multivariate data exploration tool that compares high-dimensional space navigation with a sightseeing trip. It decomposes this activity into five major tasks: 1) Identify the sights: use a map to identify the sights of interest and their location; 2) Plan the trip: connect the sights of interest along a specifyable path; 3) Go on the trip: travel along the route; 4) Hop off the bus: experience the location, look around, zoom into detail; and 5) Orient and localize: regain bearings in the map. We describe intuitive and interactive tools for all of these tasks, both global navigation within the map and local exploration of the data distributions. For the latter, we describe a polygonal touchpad interface which enables users to smoothly tilt the projection plane in high-dimensional space to produce multivariate scatterplots that best convey the data relationships under investigation. Motion parallax and illustrative motion trails aid in the perception of these transient patterns. We describe the use of our system within two applications: 1) the exploratory discovery of data configurations that best fit a personal preference in the presence of tradeoffs and 2) interactive cluster analysis via cluster sculpting in N-D.},

There are several kinds of interval estimates, but the most popular are confidence intervals (CIs): intervals that contain the true parameter value in some known proportion of repeated samples, on average. The width of confidence intervals is thought to index the precision of an estimate; CIs are thought to be a guide to which parameter values are plausible or reasonable; and the confidence coefficient of the interval (e.g., 95 \%) is thought to index the plausibility that the true parameter is included in the interval. We show in a number of examples that CIs do not necessarily have any of these properties, and can lead to unjustified or arbitrary inferences. For this reason, we caution against relying upon confidence interval theory to justify interval estimates, and suggest that other theories of interval estimation should be used instead.},

  abstract = {Computational topology is of interest in visualization because it summarizes useful global properties of a dataset. The greatest need for such abstractions is in massive data, and to date most implementations have opted for low-level languages to obtain space and time-efficient implementations. Such code is complex, and is becoming even more so with the need to operate efficiently on a range of parallel hardware. Motivated by rapid advances in functional programming and compiler technology, this chapter investigates whether a shift in programming paradigm could reduce the complexity of the task. Focusing on contour tree generation as a case study, the chapter makes three contributions. First, it sets out the development of a concise functional implementation of the algorithm. Second, it shows that the sequential functional code can be tuned to match the performance of an imperative implementation, albeit at some cost in code clarity. Third, it outlines new possiblilities for parallelisation using functional tools, and notes similarities between functional abstractions and emerging ideas in extreme-scale visualization.},

Standard tree drawing algorithms emphasize structural properties of the tree and neglect the attributes. Applying known techniques to convey this information proves hard and sometimes even impossible. We present several adaptions of popular graph drawing approaches to the problem of contour tree drawing and evaluate them. We identify five esthetic criteria for drawing contour trees and present a novel algorithm for drawing contour trees in the plane that satisfies four of these criteria. Our implementation is fast and effective for contour tree sizes usually used in interactive systems (around 100 branches) and also produces readable pictures for larger trees, as is shown for an 800 branch example.},

Studying these patterns can greatly help a variety of experts ranging from city planners and architects to human behavioral experts. Recent technological innovations have enabled the collection of enormous amounts of data that can help in these studies. However, techniques using these data sets typically focus on understanding the data in the context of the city, thus failing to capture the dynamic aspects of the city. The goal of this work is to instead understand the city in the context of multiple urban data sets. To do so, we define the concept of an ``urban pulse'' which captures the spatio-temporal activity in a city across multiple temporal resolutions. The prominent pulses in a city are obtained using the topology of the data sets, and are characterized as a set of beats. The beats are then used to analyze and compare different pulses. We also design a visual exploration framework that allows users to explore the pulses within and across multiple cities under different conditions. Finally, we present three case studies carried out by experts from two different domains that demonstrate the utility of our framework.},

  abstract = {Despite the recent popularity of visual analytics focusing on big data, little is known about how to support users that use visualization techniques to explore multi-dimensional datasets and accomplish specific tasks. Our lack of models that can assist end-users during the data exploration process has made it challenging to learn from the user's interactive and analytical process. The ability to model how a user interacts with a specific visualization technique and what difficulties they face are paramount in supporting individuals with discovering new patterns within their complex datasets. This paper introduces the notion of visualization systems understanding and modeling user interactions with the intent of guiding a user through a task thereby enhancing visual data exploration. The challenges faced and the necessary future steps to take are discussed; and to provide a working example, a grammar-based model is presented that can learn from user interactions, determine the common patterns among a number of subjects using a K-Reversible algorithm, build a set of rules, and apply those rules in the form of suggestions to new users with the goal of guiding them along their visual analytic process. A formal evaluation study with 300 subjects was performed showing that our grammar-based model is effective at capturing the interactive process followed by users and that further research in this area has the potential to positively impact how users interact with a visualization system.},

Both the objective and constraint functions are assumed to be smooth, non-linear and expensive to evaluate. As a consequence, the number of evaluations that can be used to carry out the optimization is very limited, as in complex industrial design optimization problems. The method we propose to overcome this difficulty has its roots in both the Bayesian and the multi-objective optimization literatures. More specifically, an extended domination rule is used to handle objectives and constraints in a unified way, and a corresponding expected hyper-volume improvement sampling criterion is proposed. This new criterion is naturally adapted to the search of a feasible point when none is available, and reduces to existing Bayesian sampling criteria\textemdash{}the classical Expected Improvement (EI) criterion and some of its constrained/multi-objective extensions\textemdash{}as soon as at least one feasible point is available. The calculation and optimization of the criterion are performed using Sequential Monte Carlo techniques. In particular, an algorithm similar to the subset simulation method, which is well known in the field of structural reliability, is used to estimate the criterion. The method, which we call BMOO (for Bayesian Multi-Objective Optimization), is compared to state-of-the-art algorithms for single- and multi-objective constrained optimization.},

  abstract = {We revisit the interactive model-based approach to global optimization proposed in Wang and Garcia (J Glob Optim 61(3):479\textendash{}495, 2015) in which parallel threads independently execute a model-based search method and periodically interact through a simple acceptance-rejection rule aimed at preventing duplication of search efforts. In that paper it was assumed that each thread successfully identifies a locally optimal solution every time the acceptance-rejection rule is implemented. Under this stylized model of computational time, the rate of convergence to a globally optimal solution was shown to increase exponentially in the number of threads. In practice however, the computational time required to identify a locally optimal solution varies greatly. Therefore, when the acceptance-rejection rule is implemented, several threads may fail to identify a locally optimal solution. This situation calls for reallocation of computational resources in order to speed up the identification of local optima when one or more threads repeatedly fail to do so. In this paper we consider an implementation of the interactive model-based approach that accounts for real time, that is, it takes into account the possibility that several threads may fail to identify a locally optimal solution whenever the acceptance-rejection rule is implemented. We propose a modified acceptance-rejection rule that alternates between enforcing diverse search (in order to prevent duplication) and reallocation of computational effort (in order to speed up the identification of local optima). We show that the rate of convergence in real-time increases with the number of threads. This result formalizes the idea that in parallel computing, exploitation and exploration can be complementary provided relatively simple rules for interaction are implemented. We report the results from extensive numerical experiments which are illustrate the theoretical analysis of performance.},

  volume = {19},
  issn = {1077-2626},
  abstract = {In many applications, data tables contain multi-valued attributes that often store the memberships of the table entities to multiple sets such as which languages a person masters, which skills an applicant documents, or which features a product comes with. With a growing number of entities, the resulting element-set membership matrix becomes very rich of information about how these sets overlap. Many analysis tasks targeted at set-typed data are concerned with these overlaps as salient features of such data. This paper presents Radial Sets, a novel visual technique to analyze set memberships for a large number of elements. Our technique uses frequency-based representations to enable quickly finding and analyzing different kinds of overlaps between the sets, and relating these overlaps to other attributes of the table entities. Furthermore, it enables various interactions to select elements of interest, find out if they are over-represented in specific sets or overlaps, and if they exhibit a different distribution for a specific attribute compared to the rest of the elements. These interactions allow formulating highly-expressive visual queries on the elements in terms of their set memberships and attribute values. As we demonstrate via two usage scenarios, Radial Sets enable revealing and analyzing a multitude of overlapping patterns between large sets, beyond the limits of state-of-the-art techniques.},

  abstract = {Many scientific phenomena are now investigated by complex computer models or codes. Given the input values, the code produces one or more outputs via a complex mathematical model. Often the code is expensive to run, and it may be necessary to build a computationally cheaper predictor to enable, for example, optimization of the inputs. If there are many input factors, an initial step in building a predictor is identifying (screening) the active factors. We model the output of the computer code as the realization of a stochastic process. This model has a number of advantages. First, it provides a statistical basis, via the likelihood, for a stepwise algorithm to determine the important factors. Second, it is very flexible, allowing nonlinear and interaction effects to emerge without explicitly modeling such effects. Third, the same data are used for screening and building the predictor, so expensive runs are efficiently used. We illustrate the methodology with two examples, both having 20 input variables. In these examples, we identify the important variables, detect curvature and interactions, and produce a useful predictor with 30-50 runs of the computer code.},

  abstract = {Abstract Evidence for different hypotheses is often treated as a singular construct, but it can be dissociated into two parts: its strength, the proportion of pieces of information favoring one hypothesis; and its weight, the total number of pieces of information available. However, cognitive and neural models of evidence accumulation often make a proportional representation assumption, implying that people take these two factors into account equally when making their decisions and judgments. We examine this assumption by directly manipulating the number of samples and the proportion favoring either of two alternatives in dynamic decision making and judgment tasks. The results suggest that people tend to over-emphasize the strength of evidence relative to its weight in both an optional-stopping decision task and a probability judgment task. In a drift-diffusion model, this is reflected by drift rates that are determined foremost by strength with a smaller influence of weight. This result challenges the proportional representation assumption made by existing models of judgment and decision-making, and calls into question modeling evidence accumulation as a Bayesian belief updating process.},

  abstract = {This paper sheds new light on the preference reversal phenomenon by analyzing decision times in the choice task. In a first experiment, we replicated the standard reversal pattern and found that choices associated with reversals take significantly longer than non-reversals, and non-reversal choices take longer whenever long-shot lotteries are selected. These results can be explained by a combination of noisy lottery evaluations (imprecise preferences) and an overpricing phenomenon associated with the compatibility hypothesis. The first cause explains the existence of reversals, while the second explains the predominance of a particular type thereof. A second experiment showed that the overpricing phenomenon can be shut down, greatly reducing reversals, by using ranking-based, ordinally-framed evaluation tasks. This experiment also disentangled the two determinants of reversals, because imprecise evaluations still deliver testable predictions on decision times even in the absence of the overpricing phenomenon. Strikingly, when unframed ranking tasks were used, decision times in the choice phase were greatly reduced, even though this phase was identical across treatments. This observation is consistent with psychological insights on conflicting decision processes.},

  volume = {18},
  issn = {1077-2626},
  abstract = {The extraction of significant structures in arbitrary high-dimensional data sets is a challenging task. Moreover, classifying data points as noise in order to reduce a data set bears special relevance for many application domains. Standard methods such as clustering serve to reduce problem complexity by providing the user with classes of similar entities. However, they usually do not highlight relations between different entities and require a stopping criterion, e.g. the number of clusters to be detected. In this paper, we present a visualization pipeline based on recent advancements in algebraic topology. More precisely, we employ methods from persistent homology that enable topological data analysis on high-dimensional data sets. Our pipeline inherently copes with noisy data and data sets of arbitrary dimensions. It extracts central structures of a data set in a hierarchical manner by using a persistence-based filtering algorithm that is theoretically well-founded. We furthermore introduce persistence rings, a novel visualization technique for a class of topological features-the persistence intervals-of large data sets. Persistence rings provide a unique topological signature of a data set, which helps in recognizing similarities. In addition, we provide interactive visualization techniques that assist the user in evaluating the parameter space of our method in order to extract relevant structures. We describe and evaluate our analysis pipeline by means of two very distinct classes of data sets: First, a class of synthetic data sets containing topological objects is employed to highlight the interaction capabilities of our method. Second, in order to affirm the utility of our technique, we analyse a class of high-dimensional real-world data sets arising from current research in cultural heritage.},

  volume = {147},
  issn = {0010-0277},
  abstract = {Abstract Prior studies have shown that visual statistical learning (VSL) enhances familiarity (a type of memory) of sequences. How do statistical regularities influence the processing of each triplet element and inserted distractors that disrupt the regularity? Given that increased attention to triplets induced by \{VSL\} and inhibition of unattended triplets, we predicted that \{VSL\} would promote memory for each triplet constituent, and degrade memory for inserted stimuli. Across the first two experiments, we found that objects from structured sequences were more likely to be remembered than objects from random sequences, and that letters (Experiment 1) or objects (Experiment 2) inserted into structured sequences were less likely to be remembered than those inserted into random sequences. In the subsequent two experiments, we examined an alternative account for our results, whereby the difference in memory for inserted items between structured and random conditions is due to individuation of items within random sequences. Our findings replicated even when control letters (Experiment 3A) or objects (Experiment 3B) were presented before or after, rather than inserted into, random sequences. Our findings suggest that statistical learning enhances memory for each item in a regular set and impairs memory for items that disrupt the regularity.},

  abstract = {In this article we introduce cellVIEW, a new system to interactively visualize large biomolecular datasets on the atomic level. Our tool is unique and has been specifically designed to match the ambitions of our domain experts to model and interactively visualize structures comprised of several billions atom. The cellVIEW system integrates acceleration techniques to allow for real-time graphics performance of 60 Hz display rate on datasets representing large viruses and bacterial organisms. Inspired by the work of scientific illustrators, we propose a level-of-detail scheme which purpose is two-fold: accelerating the rendering and reducing visual clutter. The main part of our datasets is made out of macromolecules, but it also comprises nucleic acids strands which are stored as sets of control points. For that specific case, we extend our rendering method to support the dynamic generation of DNA strands directly on the GPU. It is noteworthy that our tool has been directly implemented inside a game engine. We chose to rely on a third party engine to reduce software development work-load and to make bleeding-edge graphics techniques more accessible to the end-users. To our knowledge cellVIEW is the only suitable solution for interactive visualization of large bimolecular landscapes on the atomic level and is freely available to use and extend.},

  volume = {57},
  issn = {1071-5819},
  abstract = {Graphics have been used since ancient times to portray things that are inherently spatiovisual, like maps and building plans. More recently, graphics have been used to portray things that are metaphorically spatiovisual, like graphs and organizational charts. The assumption is that graphics can facilitate comprehension, learning, memory, communication and inference. Assumptions aside, research on static graphics has shown that only carefully designed and appropriate graphics prove to be beneficial for conveying complex systems. Effective graphics conform to the Congruence Principle according to which the content and format of the graphic should correspond to the content and format of the concepts to be conveyed. From this, it follows that animated graphics should be effective in portraying change over time. Yet the research on the efficacy of animated over static graphics is not encouraging. In cases where animated graphics seem superior to static ones, scrutiny reveals lack of equivalence between animated and static graphics in content or procedures; the animated graphics convey more information or involve interactivity. Animations of events may be ineffective because animations violate the second principle of good graphics, the Apprehension Principle, according to which graphics should be accurately perceived and appropriately conceived. Animations are often too complex or too fast to be accurately perceived. Moreover, many continuous events are conceived of as sequences of discrete steps. Judicious use of interactivity may overcome both these disadvantages. Animations may be more effective than comparable static graphics in situations other than conveying complex systems, for example, for real time reorientations in time and space.},

Decision-making models offer a theoretical basis for the inclusion of various personal differences (including personal value preferences) in decision-making. Research in the field of psychology has long recognized the importance of values in both motivation and choice behavior. Other research has also found personal values to be relevant in decision-making. We posit that since personal values are important in the decision-making process, they should also be important in the support of decision-making and thus in decision support systems.},

It shows that attaining insight requires discovering an effective problem representation, and that performance on insight problems can be predicted from the availability of generators and constraints in the search for such a representation. To test these claims we varied the salience of features leading to the critical concept of parity in the \{MC\} problem. Using chronometric measures, verbal protocols, and computer simulations, we explored first why it is difficult to find a representation for the Checkerboard problem, and then tested four potential sources of search constraint for reducing the difficulty: cue salience manipulations, prior knowledge, hints, and heuristics. While subjects used each of these four sources of constraint, a particular heuristic\textemdash{}noticing properties of the situation that remained invariant during solution attempts (the Notice Invariants heuristic)\textemdash{}proved to be a particularly powerful means for focusing search. In conjunction with hints and independently, it played a major part in producing the insight that yielded an effective problem representation and solution.},

  abstract = {Discriminative methods for visual object category recognition are typically non-probabilistic, predicting class labels but not directly providing an estimate of uncertainty. Gaussian Processes (GPs) are powerful regression techniques with explicit uncertainty models; we show here how Gaussian Processes with covariance functions defined based on a Pyramid Match Kernel (PMK) can be used for probabilistic object category recognition. The uncertainty model provided by GPs offers confidence estimates at test points, and naturally allows for an active learning paradigm in which points are optimally selected for interactive labeling. We derive a novel active category learning method based on our probabilistic regression model, and show that a significant boost in classification performance is possible, especially when the amount of training data for a category is ultimately very small.},

Greater average risk aversion on the part of traders in the market predicts lower market prices. The greater the level of loss aversion of the trader cohort, the lower the quantity traded. The greater the average cognitive reflection test score, the smaller the differences between market prices and fundamental values. Different treatments enable us to study how the time path of the fundamental value trajectory affects the level of adherence to fundamentals. We compare the level of mispricing between decreasing and increasing fundamental value trajectories. We find evidence for closer adherence to fundamental values when the trajectory follows a decreasing, than when it has an increasing, trend.},

  title = {Extracting Flow Features via Supervised Streamline Segmentation},
  issn = {0097-8493},
  abstract = {Abstract Effective flow feature extraction enables users to explore complex flow fields by reducing visual clutter. Existing methods usually use streamline segmentation as a preprocessing step for feature extraction. In our work, features are directly extracted as a result of streamline segmentation. In order to achieve this, we first ask users to specify desired features by manually segmenting a few streamlines from a flow field. Users only need to pick the segmentation points (i.e., positive examples) along a streamline, remaining points will be used as negative examples. Next we compute multiscale features for each positive/negative example and feed them into a binary support vector machine (SVM) trainer. The trained classifier is then used to segment all the streamlines in a flow field. Finally, the segments are clustered based on their shape similarities. Our experiment shows that very good segmentation results can be obtained with only a small number of streamlines to be segmented by users for each data set. We also propose a novel heuristic based on the minimum bounding ellipsoid volume to help determine where to segment a streamline.},

  abstract = {This paper summarizes an ongoing multi-year project aiming to uncover knowledge and techniques for devising intelligent environments for user-adaptive visualizations. We ran three studies designed to investigate the impact of user and task characteristics on user performance and satisfaction in different visualization contexts. Eye-tracking data collected in each study was analyzed to uncover possible interactions between user/task characteristics and gaze behavior during visualization processing. Finally, we investigated user models that can assess user characteristics relevant for adaptation from eye tracking data.},

  volume = {20},
  issn = {1077-2626},
  abstract = {Visual analytics enables us to analyze huge information spaces in order to support complex decision making and data exploration. Humans play a central role in generating knowledge from the snippets of evidence emerging from visual data analysis. Although prior research provides frameworks that generalize this process, their scope is often narrowly focused so they do not encompass different perspectives at different levels. This paper proposes a knowledge generation model for visual analytics that ties together these diverse frameworks, yet retains previously developed models (e.g., KDD process) to describe individual segments of the overall visual analytic processes. To test its utility, a real world visual analytics system is compared against the model, demonstrating that the knowledge generation process model provides a useful guideline when developing and evaluating such systems. The model is used to effectively compare different data analysis systems. Furthermore, the model provides a common language and description of visual analytic processes, which can be used for communication between researchers. At the end, our model reflects areas of research that future researchers can embark on.},

Participants were administered three psychometric measures designed to assess Locus of Control, Big Five Extraversion, and Big Five Neuroticism. Participants were then asked to complete procedural learning tasks in each interface. Results demonstrated that all three measures predicted completion times. Additionally, analyses demonstrated that personality factors also predicted the number of insights participants reported while completing the tasks in each interface. Furthermore, we used the psychometric findings in conjunction with a follow-up psychometric survey with a further 50 participants to build initial user profiles based on the cognitive task being undertaken. We discuss how these findings advance our ongoing research in the Personal Equation of Interaction.},

  title = {Synchronization of {{RFID}} Readers for Dense {{RFID}} Reader Environments},
  abstract = {For a dense RFID reader deployment, such as in warehouse RFID deployment, where hundreds of antennas are positioned in a building, the interference between all these readers must be studied carefully to avoid severe reader collisions. Strict RFID regulations and standards have been imposed, trying to address the problem of reader collision and also the problem of RFID devices interfering with other devices operating in nearby frequency bands. However, these guidelines and regulations are not entirely friendly for dense RFID reader deployment, in some cases it is not possible to have a feasible RFID system while adhering to these regulations. Hence, this paper proposes the synchronization of RFID readers, to enable successful dense RFID reader deployment. A case study targeted at European operations is presented in this paper to visualise the actual synchronization of RFID readers in real life applications. Some fine-tuning methods are also suggested to further improve the performance of readers in a high reader density population area},

Notably, we control for the financial aptitude of each individual. The findings suggest that the success of certain plan features depends strongly on the financial background of the participant. We find that low-knowledge individuals opt for the default allocation more often than high-knowledge individuals (experiment 1: 20\% versus 2\%). The results emphasize the importance of plan design, especially the selection of plan defaults, and the need to improve the financial literacy of participants.},

Operations management is a maturing discipline. Recently, theory driven empirical research has become common in top-tier journals in our field. Impelled by this trend and due to the path dependency of research, in general, researchers have examined operations phenomena using theories from management and organizational science. How do we extend the frontiers of knowledge in our maturing discipline? How do we develop theories within the field of operations management? In examining some of the seminal ideas that have shaped our field, a common characteristic is that they relied on observational studies and conceptual reasoning. Is it time for us to stress the usefulness of qualitative research methods in our field? Could this lead to an intellectual renewal in our field and extend the frontier of a maturing discipline? This paper explores these questions and advances the notion that qualitative analysis needs to be emphasized more than it has been in recent past. This paper is meant to provoke discussion among empirical researchers in operations management.},

  volume = {170},
  issn = {0004-3702},
  abstract = {Evaluative arguments are pervasive in natural human communication. In countless situations people attempt to advise or persuade their interlocutors that something is desirable (vs. undesirable) or right (vs. wrong). With the proliferation of on-line systems serving as personal advisors and assistants, there is a pressing need to develop general and testable computational models for generating and presenting evaluative arguments. Previous research on generating evaluative arguments has been characterized by two major limitations. First, researchers have tended to focus only on specific aspects of the generation process. Second, the proposed approaches were not empirically tested. The research presented in this paper addresses both limitations. We have designed and implemented a complete computational model for generating evaluative arguments. For content selection and organization, we devised an argumentation strategy based on guidelines from argumentation theory. For expressing the content in natural language, we extended and integrated previous work in computational linguistics on generating evaluative arguments. The key knowledge source for both tasks is a quantitative model of user preferences. To empirically test critical aspects of our generation model, we have devised and implemented an evaluation framework in which the effectiveness of evaluative arguments can be measured with real users. Within the framework, we have performed an experiment to test two basic hypotheses on which the design of the computational model is based; namely, that our proposal for tailoring an evaluative argument to the addressee's preferences increases its effectiveness, and that differences in conciseness significantly influence argument effectiveness. The second hypothesis was confirmed in the experiment. In contrast, the first hypothesis was only marginally confirmed. However, independent testing by other researchers has recently provided further support for this hypothesis.},

In this paper, we extend this research by isolating factors in personality traits as well as in the visualizations that could have contributed to the observed correlation. We focus on a personality trait known as ``locus of control,'' which represents a person's tendency to see themselves as controlled by or in control of external events. To isolate variables of the visualization design, we control extraneous factors such as color, interaction, and labeling, and specifically focus on the overall layout style of the visualizations. We conduct a user study with four visualizations that gradually shift from an indentation metaphor to a containment metaphor and compare the participants' speed, accuracy, and preference with their locus of control. Our findings demonstrate that there is indeed a correlation between the two: participants with an internal locus of control perform more poorly with visualizations that employ a containment metaphor, while those with an external locus of control perform well with such visualizations. We discuss a possible explanation for this relationship based in cognitive psychology and propose that these results can be used to better understand how people use visualizations and how to adapt visual analytics design to an individual user's needs.},

This article reviews recent research on individual differences in visualization and human-computer interaction, showing that both cognitive abilities and personality profiles might significantly affect performance with these tools. The study of individual differences has led to the conclusion that advances in this important area in visualization will require more focused research. Specifically, we must isolate the cognitive factors that are relevant to visualization and the design factors that make one visualization more suited to a user than another. In doing so, we could increase our understanding of the visualization user and reshape how we approach design and evaluation.},

Through participation in an interactive behavioral simulation, 407 participants confronted over one hundred ill-structured decision situations and proposed whatever actions they perceived appropriate. The results support the hypothesized relationships that individuals with different personality-type preferences (i.e., sensing-thinking, intuition-thinking, sensing-feeling, and intuition-feeling) take patterns of actions that reflect specific biases (i.e., selective perception, positivity, social desirability, and reasoning-by-analogy, respectively).

Given a bitmap image of a chart as input, ReVision applies computer vision and machine learning techniques to identify the chart type (e.g., pie chart, bar chart, scatterplot, etc.). It then extracts the graphical marks and infers the underlying data. Using a corpus of images drawn from the web, ReVision achieves image classification accuracy of 96\% across ten chart categories. It also accurately extracts marks from 79\% of bar charts and 62\% of pie charts, and from these charts it successfully extracts data from 71\% of bar charts and 64\% of pie charts. ReVision then applies perceptually-based design principles to populate an interactive gallery of redesigned charts.

Key articles and materials were obtained from MEDLINE\textregistered{} and PsychInfo\textregistered{} databases, from reference article citations, and from discussion with experts in risk communication. Research has been devoted primarily to communicating risk magnitudes. Among the various graphical displays, the risk ladder appears to be a promising tool for communicating absolute and relative risks. Preliminary evidence suggests that people understand risk information presented in histograms and pie charts. Areas that need further attention include 1) applying theoretical models to the visual communication of risk, 2) testing which graphical displays can be applied best to different risk communication tasks (e.g., which graphs best convey absolute or relative risks), 3) communicating risk uncertainty, and 4) testing whether the lay public's perceptions and understanding of risk varies by graphical format and whether the addition of graphical displays improves comprehension substantially beyond numerical or narrative translations of risk and, if so, by how much. There is a need to ascertain the extent to which graphics and other visuals enhance the public's understanding of disease risk to facilitate decision-making and behavioral change processes. Nine suggestions are provided to help achieve these ends.},

  title = {Visual Market Sector Analysis for Financial Time Series Data},
  abstract = {The massive amount of financial time series data that originates from the stock market generates large amounts of complex data of high interest. However, adequate solutions that can effectively handle the information in order to gain insight and to understand the market mechanisms are rare. In this paper, we present two techniques and applications that enable the user to interactively analyze large amounts of time series data in real-time in order to get insight into the development of assets, market sectors, countries, and the financial market as a whole. The first technique allows users to quickly analyze combinations of single assets, market sectors as well as countries, compare them to each other, and to visually discover the periods of time where market sectors and countries get into turbulence. The second application clusters a selection of large amounts of financial time series data according to their similarity, and analyzes the distribution of the assets among market sectors. This allows users to identify the characteristic graphs which are representative for the development of a particular market sector, and also to identify the assets which behave considerably differently compared to other assets in the same sector. Both applications allow the user to perform investigative exploration techniques and interactive visual analysis in real-time.},

  abstract = {We are all faced with uncertainty about the future, but we can get the measure of some uncertainties in terms of probabilities. Probabilities are notoriously difficult to communicate effectively to lay audiences, and in this review we examine current practice for communicating uncertainties visually, using examples drawn from sport, weather, climate, health, economics, and politics. Despite the burgeoning interest in infographics, there is limited experimental evidence on how different types of visualizations are processed and understood, although the effectiveness of some graphics clearly depends on the relative numeracy of an audience. Fortunately, it is increasingly easy to present data in the form of interactive visualizations and in multiple types of representation that can be adjusted to user needs and capabilities. Nonetheless, communicating deeper uncertainties resulting from incomplete or disputed knowledge\textemdash{}or from essential indeterminacy about the future\textemdash{}remains a challenge.},

Participants (n \$=\$ 140) rated the probability that the boundary between two earth layers passed through a given point, for seven different visualizations of the positional uncertainty of the boundary. For all types of visualizations, most observers appear to construct an internal model of the uncertainty distribution that closely resembles a normal distribution. However, the visual form of the uncertainty range (i.e., the visualization type) affects this internal model and the internal model relates to participants' numeracy. We conclude that perceived certainty is affected by its visual representation. In a follow-up experiment we found no indications that the absence (or presence) of a prominent center line in the visualization affects the internal model. We discuss if and how our results inform which visual representation is most suitable for representing uncertainty and make suggestions for future work.},

We present a system that combines an automatic evaluation of process layouts and an interactive visual interface to create a novel iterative analysis cycle of modifying process layouts based on insights gained from previous attempts. Visualizing the drawbacks and benefits of different options could help users find a good layout to meet their requirements. Although this system is specific to the manufacturing domain, we are certain this iterative approach can be extended to other tasks that involve finding better solutions based on previous iterations.},

Although the application of the method is illustrated in the context of verbal data such as explanations, interviews, problem-solving protocols, and retrospective reports, in principle, the mechanics of the method can be adapted for coding other types of qualitative data, such as gestures and videotapes. The mechanics of the method are outlined in 8 concrete steps. Although verbal analyses can be used for many purposes, the main goal of the analyses discussed here is to formulate an understanding of the representation of the knowledge used in cognitive performances and how that representation changes with learning. This can be contrasted with another method of analyzing verbal protocols, the goal of which is to validate the cognitive processes of human performance, often as embodied in a computational model.},

  title = {Visual Analysis of High-Dimensional Parameter Spaces},
  abstract = {We present a system called Tuner to systematically analyze the parameter space of com- plex computer simulations, which are time consuming to run and consequently cannot be exhaustively sampled. We begin with a sparse initial sampling of the parameter space, then use these samples to create a fast emulator of the simulation. Analyzing this emulator gives the user insight on further sampling the simulation. Tuner guides the user through sampling and provides tools to find optimal parameter settings of up to two objective functions and perform sensitivity analysis. We present use-cases from the domain of image segmentation algorithms. Since our method must utilize samples of the simulation and relies on an inherently interactive visualization method, we perform a complexity analysis to see how many sam- ples can be rendered while staying interactive. We examined how rendering performance changes with the dimensionality, reconstruction kernel size, and number of sample points. To study this, we decomposed the rendering complexity into a predictive cost function that combines the cost of filtering each data point and then the cost to draw each pixel on screen. This cost function is calibrated to the time to filter and draw for two different hardware configurations. The cost formulation is used to examine the effects on rendering time from using box filtering versus a radial distance measure in high-dimensional data spaces as used for the filtered scatterplot and HyperSlice visualization methods, respectively. We find that for a constant kernel volume, rendering performance increases with dimensionality in the HyperSlice technique while it decreases with the filtered scatterplot technique. We also find that the total number of sample points and not the size of the reconstruction kernel is a much stronger determinant of the rendering time.},

We confirmed that subjects find it difficult to deduce a valid conclusion, such as Julia is in Atlanta, or both Raphael is in Tacoma and Paul is in Philadelphia. In a preliminary study, the format of the premises was either verbal or diagrammatic, and the diagrams used icons to distinguish between inclusive and exclusive disjunctions. The diagrams had no effect on performance. In the main experiment, the diagrams made the alternative possibilities more explicit. The subjects responded faster (about 35 s) and drew many more valid conclusions (nearly 30\%) from the diagrams than from the verbal premises.

Advancing this knowledge into applied areas is hampered by this present disagreement. A series of experiments used Bayesian reasoning problems with different pictorial representations (Venn circles, iconic symbols and Venn circles with dots) to better understand influences on performance across these representation types. Results with various static and interactive presentations of pictures all indicate a consistent advantage for iconic representations. These results are more consistent with an ecological rationality view of how these pictorial representations achieve facilitation in statistical task performance and provide more specific guidance for applied uses.

The theory offers untested empirical implications about volume, volatility, fundamental/price ratios, and mean returns, and is consistent with several empirical findings. These include the ability of fundamental/price ratios and market value to forecast returns, and the domination of beta by these variables in some studies.},

  abstract = {Working with three domain specialists we investigate human-centered approaches to geovisualization following an ISO13407 taxonomy covering context of use, requirements and early stages of design. Our case study, undertaken over three years, draws attention to repeating trends: that generic approaches fail to elicit adequate requirements for geovis application design; that the use of real data is key to understanding needs and possibilities; that trust and knowledge must be built and developed with collaborators. These processes take time but modified human-centred approaches can be effective. A scenario developed through contextual inquiry but supplemented with domain data and graphics is useful to geovis designers. Wireframe, paper and digital prototypes enable successful communication between specialist and geovis domains when incorporating real and interesting data, prompting exploratory behaviour and eliciting previously unconsidered requirements. Paper prototypes are particularly successful at eliciting suggestions, especially for novel visualization. Enabling specialists to explore their data freely with a digital prototype is as effective as using a structured task protocol and is easier to administer. Autoethnography has potential for framing the design process. We conclude that a common understanding of context of use, domain data and visualization possibilities are essential to successful geovis design and develop as this progresses. HC approaches can make a significant contribution here. However, modified approaches, applied with flexibility, are most promising. We advise early, collaborative engagement with data - through simple, transient visual artefacts supported by data sketches and existing designs - before moving to successively more sophisticated data wireframes and data prototypes.},

  abstract = {The emerging judgment and decision-making literature indicates that individuals use heuristic procedures that simplify cognitive processing requirements. Judgments (particularly subjective probabilities) are based on limited processing of a proper subset of the available evidence. Tasks potentially calling for complex analysis are reduced to heuristic procedures and efficient information processing may result; these heuristics can, however, produce systematic biases and costly errors in judgment.People also exhibit cognitive biases that systematically affect judgments of statistical properties of random variables. The biases appear to be cognitive in nature and therefore are not due entirely to emotional, motivational, or cost-of-processing considerations. For some cognitive biases, a possible explanation has been suggested in the context of a heuristic processing procedure.The objective of this paper is to analyze and synthesize the currently available research on cognitive heuristics and information-processing biases from the perspective of research and actual financial decision situations. Important implications for users and designers of information systems will be discussed. One generic conclusion from the literature is that individuals appear to be inadequate ``intuitive'' statisticians; a need for formal judgment and decision aids will become clear.},

Wealthier, highly educated, older investors working in the finance sector and those trading relatively often show higher diversification levels possibly because they are better equipped to obtain and process information. Finance professionals, married investors, and those placing high-volume orders through investment centers show poorer diversification possibly as a reflection of overconfidence.

  abstract = {This study used questionnaires completed by MBA finance students to test the degree of investors' rationality when the latter construct a portfolio or make loan decisions. We found that with respect to stock decisions, irrationality cannot be established. Investment in stocks was found to be influenced by expectations, past experience in the capital market, and knowledge about the past performance of selected market indices. With respect to corporate bonds, we found that, as expected, expectations about interest rate changes influenced the decision to invest in those bonds, as did past experience in the capital markets. The decision to invest in government bonds was the decision least likely to be based on rationality. With respect to loans, we found an expected negative relationship between the willingness to take out loans based on the prime interest rate and expectations about changes in interest rates.},

We focus on individuals' attitudes toward risk and identify relevant factors that affect the willingness to take financial risks. Our empirical evidence contradicts standard portfolio theory, as it does not indicate a significant relationship between risk aversion and financial risk taking. However, our analysis supports the behavioral view that psychological factors rooted in national culture affect portfolio choice. Individualism, which is linked to overconfidence and overoptimism, has a significantly positive effect on financial risk taking. In microdata from Germany and Singapore, as well as in cross-country data, we find evidence consistent with low levels of individualism being an important factor in explaining the limited participation puzzle.},

Because this software is accessible by non-expert users, decision-makers from the general population can benefit greatly from using FinVis in practical applications. We quantify the value of FinVis using experimental economics methods and find that subjects using the FinVis software make better financial portfolio decisions as compared to subjects using a tabular version with the same information. We also find that FinVis engages the user, which results in greater exploration of the dataset and increased learning as compared to a tabular display. Further, participants using FinVis reported increased confidence in financial decision-making and noted that they were likely to use this tool in practical application.},

NDM helped identify important areas of inquiry previously neglected (e.g. the use of expertise in sizing up situations and generating options), it introduced new models, conceptualizations, and methods, and recruited applied investigators into the field. Above all, NDM contributed a new perspective on how decisions (broadly defined as committing oneself to a certain course of action) are made. NDM still faces significant challenges, including improvement of the quantity and rigor of its empirical research, and confirming the validity of its prescriptive models.

While the field of statistical graphics is well established, only a few 2D and 3D visualization and feature extraction methods have been devised that consider uncertainty. We present mathematical formulations for uncertain equivalents of isocontours based on standard probability theory and statistics and employ them in interactive visualization methods. As input data, we consider discretized uncertain scalar fields and model these as random fields. To create a continuous representation suitable for visualization we introduce interpolated probability density functions. Furthermore, we introduce numerical condition as a general means in feature-based visualization. The condition number-which potentially diverges in the isocontour problem-describes how errors in the input data are amplified in feature computation. We show how the average numerical condition of isocontours aids the selection of thresholds that correspond to robust isocontours. Additionally, we introduce the isocontour density and the level crossing probability field; these two measures for the spatial distribution of uncertain isocontours are directly based on the probabilistic model of the input data. Finally, we adapt interactive visualization methods to evaluate and display these measures and apply them to 2D and 3D data sets.},

To help decision makers manage ambiguity, the authors developed and evaluated a domain-independent decision support system (DSS), the Uncertainty DSS. It is designed to help decision makers recognize situations in which uncertainty creates ambiguity in their choices and to identify information that can help reduce that ambiguity. It does so by providing an uncertainty visualization, which shows when the range of possible values for two or more alternatives overlap, indicating that one cannot identify the best alternative given the current information. To evaluate the Uncertainty DSS, the authors created a pared-down version, the Certainty DSS, which provides no uncertainty visualizations. They recruited 22 engineering designers and asked them compare alternative designs from real, ongoing design projects using no DSS, the Certainty DSS, and the Uncertainty DSS. The authors found that without the visualizations, participants did not distinguish between ambiguous and unambiguous choices. However, the Uncertainty DSS improved participants' ability to recognize ambiguous decision situations. Additionally, it increased the likelihood that participants would form plans to seek clarifying information. These results suggest that a relatively simple visualization can change the way in which designers think about decision choices.},

  volume = {15},
  abstract = {A continuing trend in computer representation of three dimensional synthetic scenes is the ever more accurate modelling of complex illumination effects. Such effects provide cues necessary for a convincing illusion of reality. The best current methods simulate multiple specular reflections and refractions, but handle at most one scattering bounce per light ray. They cannot accurately simulate diffuse light sources, nor indirect lighting via scattering media, without prohibitive increases in the already very large computing costs. Conventional methods depend implicitly on a particle model; light propagates in straight and conceptually infinitely thin rays. This paper argues that a wave model has important computational advantages for the complex situations. In this approach, light is represented by wave fronts which are stored as two dimensional arrays of complex numbers. The propagation of such a front can be simulated by a linear transformation. Several advantages accrue. Propagations in a direction orthogonal to the plane of a front are convolutions which can be done by FFT in O(n log n) time rather than the n 2 time for a similar operation using rays. A typical speedup is about 10,000. The wavelength of the illumination sets a resolution limit which prevents unnecessary computation of elements smaller than will be visible. The generated wavefronts contain multiplicities of views of the scene, which can be individually extracted by passing them through different simulated lenses. Lastly the wavefront calculations are ideally suited for implementation on available array processors, which provide more cost effective calculation for this task than general purpose computers. The wave method eliminates the aliasing problem; the wavefronts are inherently spatially filtered, but substitutes diffraction effects and depth of focus limitations in its stead.},

These categories are organized around a user's intent while interacting with a system rather than the low-level interaction techniques provided by a system. The categories can act as a framework to help discuss and evaluate interaction techniques and hopefully lay an initial foundation toward a deeper understanding and a science of interaction.},

  title = {Approximate Maximum Likelihood Inference for Coalescent Models},
  abstract = {Exact likelihoods are hard to obtain in many realistic estimation prob- lems, hence, approximate inference methods like ABC became popular in recent years. In their most basic form, these methods involve sampling from the parameter space and keeping those parameters that produce data that fit best to the actually observed data. Exploring the whole param- eter space however, does not make this approach very efficient in high dimensional problems. Here we propose a novel approach to approximate the maximum like- lihood estimate based on stochastic gradient methods. By moving along a simulated gradient of the likelihood, the algorithm produces a sequence of estimates that will eventually converge to the maximum likelihood esti- mate. This approach reduces the number of simulations in regions of low likelihood while being flexibly applicable to a large variety of problems. As it turns out that good tuning of the algorithm can greatly im- prove the convergence speed, we complete the method with a strategy for on-the-fly tuning. In this paper we present simulation results on the performance of the approximate maximum likelihood algorithm and an application from the field of population genetics, estimating parameters describing the ancestral history of Sumatran and Bornean orang-utans. To facilitate population genetic applications, the method is implemented in the coalescent simulator msms [6].},

  title = {On Numerical Stability in Large Scale Linear Algebraic Computations},
  volume = {85},
  issn = {1521-4001},
  abstract = {Numerical solving of real-world problems typically consists of several stages. After a mathematical description of the problem and its proper reformulation and discretisation, the resulting linear algebraic problem has to be solved. We focus on this last stage, and specifically consider numerical stability of iterative methods in matrix computations. In iterative methods, rounding errors have two main effects: They can delay convergence and they can limit the maximal attainable accuracy. It is important to realize that numerical stability analysis is not about derivation of error bounds or estimates. Rather the goal is to find algorithms and their parts that are safe (numerically stable), and to identify algorithms and their parts that are not. Numerical stability analysis demonstrates this important idea, which also guides this contribution. In our survey we first recall the concept of backward stability and discuss its use in numerical stability analysis of iterative methods. Using the backward error approach we then examine the surprising fact that the accuracy of a (final) computed result may be much higher than the accuracy of intermediate computed quantities. We present some examples of rounding error analysis that are fundamental to justify numerically computed results.

I argue that this crisis follows the failure of widely adopted solutions to psychology's similar crisis of the 1970s. The untouched root cause is an information-economic one: Too many studies divided by too few publication outlets equals a bottleneck. Articles cannot pass through just by showing theoretical meaning and methodological rigor; their results must appear to support the hypothesis perfectly. Consequently, psychologists must master the art of presenting perfect-looking results just to survive in the profession. This favors aesthetic criteria of presentation in a way that harms science's search for truth. Shallow standards of statistical perfection distort analyses and undermine the accuracy of cumulative data; narrative expectations encourage dishonesty about the relationship between results and hypotheses; criteria of novelty suppress replication attempts. Concerns about truth in research are emerging in other sciences and may eventually descend on our heads in the form of difficult and insensitive regulations. I suggest a more palatable solution: to open the bottleneck, putting structures in place to reward broader forms of information sharing beyond the exquisite art of present-day journal publication.},

In this article the author reviews and comments on the claimed misunderstandings as well as on other criticisms of the approach, and he notes arguments that have been advanced in support of NHST. Alternatives and supplements to NHST are considered, as are several related recommendations regarding the interpretation of experimental data. The concluding opinion is that NHST is easily misunderstood and misused but that when applied with good judgment it can be an effective aid to the interpretation of experimental data.},

The goal is to enable a style of design with simulations that feels as-direct-as-possible so users can concentrate on creative design tasks. The approach integrates forward design via direct manipulation of simulation inputs (e.g., geometric properties, applied forces) in the same visual space with inverse design via 'tugging' and reshaping simulation outputs (e.g., scalar fields from finite element analysis (FEA) or computational fluid dynamics (CFD)). The interface includes algorithms for interpreting the intent of users' drag operations relative to parameterized models, morphing arbitrary scalar fields output from FEA and CFD simulations, and in-place interactive ensemble visualization. The inverse design strategy can be extended to use multi-touch input in combination with an as-rigid-as-possible shape manipulation to support rich visual queries. The potential of this new design approach is confirmed via two applications: medical device engineering of a vacuum-assisted biopsy device and visual effects design using a physically based flame simulation.},

There are numerous such measures for capital projects. They are broadly divided into ``accounting'' measures, such as return on investment, and discounted cash flow measures, such as net present value. The difference between the two is that the discounted cash flow measures account for the time value of money, whereas the other do not. The payback period and the return on investment are two of the accounting measures. These have the advantage that they are easy to calculate and intuitively easy to interpret. However, for major capital projects that are expected to last a number of years, discounted cash flow techniques are preferred. The two most popular of the discounted cash flow techniques are the net present value and the internal rate of return. Other techniques that are discussed are, amongst others, the benefit-cost ratio and the equivalent annual charge. The net present value and the internal rate of return do not always make the same recommendation for a project. The reasons for this disagreement are considered. A case study is presented in which the application of the criteria is demonstrated.},

However, accurately understanding the shape of multidimensional points from 2D projections remains challenging due to overlap. Consequently, there are a lot of variations on the scatterplot as a visual metaphor for this limitation. An important aspect often overlooked in scatterplots is the issue of sensitivity or local trend, which may help in identifying the type of relationship between two variables. However, it is not well known how or what factors influence the perception of trends from 2D scatterplots. To shed light on this aspect, we conducted an experiment where we asked people to directly draw the perceived trends on a 2D scatterplot. We found that augmenting scatterplots with local sensitivity helps to fill the gaps in visual perception while retaining the simplicity and readability of a 2D scatterplot. We call this augmentation the generalized sensitivity scatterplot (GSS). In a GSS, sensitivity coefficients are visually depicted as flow lines, which give a sense of continuity and orientation of the data that provide cues about the way data points are scattered in a higher dimensional space. We introduce a series of glyphs and operations that facilitate the analysis of multidimensional data sets using GSS, and validate with a number of well-known data sets for both regression and classification tasks.},

They can be used to summarize the effects of parameter changes (without requiring the designer to perform extensive play-testing); and\textemdash{}when augmented with designer-provided evaluation functions\textemdash{}allow automatic parameter selection.

Using probit regression as a working example, this paper presents a simple methodology based on Markov chain Monte Carlo and the pseudo-marginal approach that efficiently addresses both those questions. The results presented in this paper show improvements over previous approaches for sampling from the posterior distribution of the parameters of the covariance function of the Gaussian Process prior. This is particularly important as it offers a powerful tool to carry out the fully Bayesian treatment of Gaussian Process based statistical models. The results also demonstrate that Monte Carlo based integration of all model parameters is actually feasible providing a superior quantification of uncertainty in predictions. Comparison with respect to state-of-the-art probabilistic classifiers confirm this assertion. Finally, this paper demonstrates with an application on a financial time series that the proposed methodology can exploit sparsity in the inverse covariance of the Gaussian Process prior leading to a computationally efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo approach.},

The attribute space is visualized as a function of the number of voxels, allowing the user to explore the data in terms of the attribute size/magnitude. However, such visualizations provide the user with no information on the relationship between various attribute spaces (e.g., density, temperature, pressure, x, y, z) within the multivariate data. In this work, we propose a modification to the attribute space visualization in which the user is no longer presented with the magnitude of the attribute; instead, the user is presented with an information metric detailing the relationship between attributes of the multivariate volumetric data. In this way, the user can guide their exploration based on the relationship between the attribute magnitude and user selected attribute information as opposed to being constrained by only visualizing the magnitude of the attribute. We refer to this modification to the traditional histogram widget as an abstract attribute space representation. Our system utilizes common one and two-dimensional histogram widgets where the bins of the abstract attribute space now correspond to an attribute relationship in terms of the mean, standard deviation, entropy, or skewness. In this manner, we exploit the relationships and correlations present in the underlying data with respect to the dimension(s) under examination. These relationships are often times key to insight and allow us to guide attribute discovery as opposed to automatic extraction schemes which try to calculate and extract distinct attributes a priori. In this way, our system aids in the knowledge discovery of the interaction of properties within volumetric data.},

Of the numerous types of response surface models, kriging is perhaps one of the most effective, due to its ability to model complicated responses through interpolation or regression of known data while providing an estimate of the error in its prediction. There is, however, little information indicating the extent to which the hyperparameters of a kriging model need to be tuned for the resulting surrogate model to be effective. The following paper addresses this issue by investigating how often and how well it is necessary to tune the hyperparameters of a kriging model as it is updated during an optimization process. To this end, an optimization benchmarking procedure is introduced and used to assess the performance of five different tuning strategies over a range of problem sizes. The results of this benchmark demonstrate the performance gains that can be associated with reducing the complexity of the hyperparameter tuning process for complicated design problems. The strategy of tuning hyperparameters only once after the initial design of experiments is shown to perform poorly.},

  abstract = {The deposition of heightened levels of sulfuric and nitric acid through rainfall in the United States may adversely affect the environment. For example, soils may become toxic to native tree species because of soil acidification. Ecological effects models being built to study these potential problems have a need for regional deposition estimates with associated measures of uncertainty. However, statistical estimation of the deposition process is complicated by a strong spatial trend (mean nonstationarity) and apparently a spatial covariance structure dependent on location (covariance nonstationarity). The available data for calculating deposition estimates consist of several hundred point observations at irregularly spaced sampling locations across the United States. The spatial estimation technique of kriging is the foundation of four deposition estimation methods evaluated in this study. These are lognormal kriging with a single model of the spatial covariance structure (the variogram); single-estimate lognormal kriging within a moving window using a local model of the variogram; ordinary kriging within a moving window, also with a local variogram model; and planar regression with spatially correlated errors within a moving window used to estimate residuals that are then input to the moving window ordinary kriging algorithm to calculate a (local) trend-adjusted estimate. Each of these four methods has some capacity for accommodating mean and covariance nonstationarity. The moving window methods are new. It is shown that the log transform may not be the correct transform for the deposition process. However, confidence intervals found from a lognormal kriging method do not include a negative interval, as can frequently occur with intervals found from ordinary kriging. Assuming that a partially negative confidence interval for deposition is interpretable, the method of local planar regressions followed by residual kriging gives confidence interval widths that are the most resistant to inflation due to trend effects on the variogram and trend-dependent variance.},

Our design space consists of five design dimensions that characterize the main aspects of tasks and that have so far been distributed across different task descriptions. We exemplify its concrete use by applying our design space in the domain of climate impact research.

Among strategies coined for computer experiments, Latin hypercube designs have become particularly popular. This paper provides a short overview of the research in Latin hypercube design of experiments, highlighting potential reasons of its widespread use. The discussion starts with the early developments in optimization of the point selection and goes all the way to the pitfalls of always using Latin hypercube designs for selecting experimental designs. Then, final thoughts are given on how the Latin hypercube design fits in the state of the art as well as opportunities for future research.},

It is shown that when the model output is smooth with regards to the inputs, a spectral convergence of the computed sensitivity indices is achieved. However, even for smooth outputs the method is limited to a moderate number of inputs, say 10\textendash{}20, as it becomes computationally too demanding to reach the convergence domain. Alternative methods (such as sampling strategies) are then more attractive. The method is also challenged when the output is non-smooth even when the number of inputs is limited.},

  abstract = {An uncertain (scalar, vector, tensor) field is usually perceived as a discrete random field with a priori unknown probability distributions. To compute derived probabilities, e.g. for the occurrence of certain features, an appropriate probabilistic model has to be selected. The majority of previous approaches in uncertainty visualization were restricted to Gaussian fields. In this paper we extend these approaches to nonparametric models, which are much more flexible, as they can represent various types of distributions, including multimodal and skewed ones. We present three examples of nonparametric representations: (a) empirical distributions, (b) histograms and (c) kernel density estimates (KDE). While the first is a direct representation of the ensemble data, the latter two use reconstructed probability density functions of continuous random variables. For KDE we propose an approach to compute valid consistent marginal distributions and to efficiently capture correlations using a principal component transformation. Furthermore, we use automatic bandwidth selection, obtaining a model for probabilistic local feature extraction. The methods are demonstrated by computing probabilities of level crossings, critical points and vortex cores in simulated biofluid dynamics and climate data.},

Given a set of categorical values and a target color palette, our algorithm matches each data value with a unique color. Values are mapped to colors by collecting representative images, analyzing image color distributions to determine value-color affinity scores, and choosing an optimal assignment. Our affinity score balances the probability of a color with how well it discriminates among data values. A controlled study shows that expert-chosen semantically-resonant colors improve speed on chart reading tasks compared to a standard palette, and that our algorithm selects colors that lead to similar gains. A second study verifies that our algorithm effectively selects colors across a variety of data categories.},

We start with a disk, which is successively distorted. The crucial step is to show an animation of the effect of taking a root of a subset of the complex plane. We present four different approaches for this, using a Riemann surface, a corkscrew, a fan, and disks as metaphors. We packaged our results in an interactive tool with a simple interface, such that everybody can view and inspect these for different Julia sets. The results are useful for teaching complex analysis, promoting mathematics, entertainment, and, above all, as a visual explanation for the complexity of Julia sets.},

We describe its design choices and basic abstractions of our conceptual architecture and demonstrate its applicability by a number of case studies. EvalBench reduces implementation effort for evaluation features and makes conducting user studies easier.

We utilize kriging interpolation to estimate a response surface which minimizes the expectation value and variance of the prediction error. High computational efficiency is achieved by employing parallel matrix and vector operations on the GPU. Our approach differs from previous kriging approaches in that it uses a novel progressive updating scheme for new samples based on blockwise matrix inversion. In this way we can handle very large sample sets to which new samples are continually added. Furthermore, we can monitor the incremental evolution of the surface, providing a means to early terminate the computation when no significant changes have occurred. When the generation of input samples is fast enough, our technique enables steering this generation process interactively to find relevant dependency relations.},

In many disciplines, data and model scenarios are becoming multifaceted: data are often spatiotemporal and multivariate; they stem from different data sources (multimodal data), from multiple simulation runs (multirun/ensemble data), or from multiphysics simulations of interacting phenomena (multimodel data resulting from coupled simulation models). Also, data can be of different dimensionality or structured on various types of grids that need to be related or fused in the visualization. This heterogeneity of data characteristics presents new opportunities as well as technical challenges for visualization research. Visualization and interaction techniques are thus often combined with computational analysis. In this survey, we study existing methods for visualization and interactive visual analysis of multifaceted scientific data. Based on a thorough literature review, a categorization of approaches is proposed. We cover a wide range of fields and discuss to which degree the different challenges are matched with existing solutions for visualization and visual analysis.

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel and comprehensive method for the automated determination of correspondences between two morphologically different two-dimensional (2-D) or three-dimensional (3-D) objects. Correspondences are determined by warping parametric representations of the objects to be matched. The warp is guided by the minimization of a similarity criterion function that measures features related to structural correspondence, including Euclidian point-to-point distance and differences in normals and curvature. The method uses a continuous harmonic parameterization for both the object and the warp, which provides: 1) a high degree of computational efficiency; 2) robust extraction of differential features, not subject to discretization errors or noise amplification in differentiation; 3) direct formulation of constraints to avoid overlaps in the resulting correspondence set; and 4) a scale-space paradigm of object shape and warp. The new method does not search for individual landmarks, but operates with a complete, integrated representation of the object geometry. The method was tested on 2-D and 3-D objects with substantial shape differences. Results demonstrated substantial improvements of 2\%-33\% in correspondence accuracy and 15\%-59\% in correspondence quality compared with direct registration methods.},

One promising approach for providing feedback about residential energy consumption is the use of ambient and artistic visualizations. Pervasive computing technologies enable the integration of such feedback into the home in the form of distributed point-of-consumption feedback devices to support decision-making in everyday activities. However, introducing these devices into the home requires sensitivity to the domestic context. In this paper we describe three abstract visualizations and suggest four design requirements that this type of device must meet to be effective: pragmatic, aesthetic, ambient, and ecological. We report on the findings from a mixed methods user study that explores the viability of using ambient and artistic feedback in the home based on these requirements. Our findings suggest that this approach is a viable way to provide resource use feedback and that both the aesthetics of the representation and the context of use are important elements that must be considered in this design space.},

This problem arises in the following way: we compute a descriptive statistic from a set of data, notice an interesting feature and wish to assign a confidence level to that feature. For example, we compute a density estimate and notice that the estimate is bimodal. What confidence can we assign to bimodality? A natural way to measure confidence is via the bootstrap: we compute our descriptive statistic on a large number of bootstrap data sets and record the proportion of times that the feature appears. This seems like a plausible measure of confidence for the feature. The paper studies the construction of such confidence values and examines to what extent they approximate frequentist p-values and Bayesian a posteriori probabilities. We derive more accurate confidence levels using both frequentist and objective Bayesian approaches. The methods are illustrated with a number of examples, including polynomial model selection and estimating the number of modes of a density.},

  abstract = {A training set of data has been used to construct a rule for predicting future responses. What is the error rate of this rule? This is an important question both for comparing models and for assessing a final selected model. The traditional answer to this question is given by cross-validation. The cross-validation estimate of prediction error is nearly unbiased but can be highly variable. Here we discuss bootstrap estimates of prediction error, which can be thought of as smoothed versions of cross-validation. We show that a particular bootstrap method, the .632+ rule, substantially outperforms cross-validation in a catalog of 24 simulation experiments. Besides providing point estimates, we also consider estimating the variability of an error rate estimate. All of the results here are nonparametric and apply to any possible prediction rule; however, we study only classification problems with 0-1 loss in detail. Our simulations include "smooth" prediction rules like Fisher's linear discriminant function and unsmooth ones like nearest neighbors.},

  volume = {117},
  issn = {0010-4655},
  abstract = {Sensitivity analysis is often performed in connection with uncertainty analysis, the latter being the prime objective. In this context, the aim of sensitivity analysis is to identify the main contributors to model output uncertainty. Therefore the term {\^a}\texteuro{\o} eUncertainty Importance Analysis{\^a}\texteuro{} is sometimes used. In general, uncertainty analysis proceeds by Monte Carlo simulation. The affordable number of model runs is usually small for processor-time or computationally intensive models. This has consequences for the type of uncertainty statements needed. For efficiency reasons, sensitivity analysis cannot afford a separate specifically chosen set of model runs but has to use those that were performed for the purpose of uncertainty analysis. Since their number n is small and the number m of uncertainties is frequently large, correlation coefficients and standardized regression coefficients, the latter possibly obtained from stepwise regression, are a reasonable choice of sensitivity measures. Spurious correlation is inevitably present in the multivariate sample of size n and can often not be reduced or eliminated. The correlation ratio is an indispensable sensitivity measure, whenever model uncertainty is expressed by more than two model alternatives or when measures, quantifying degrees of linear or monotone relationship, are not adequate. As a consequence of the small sample size, the correlation ratio is affordable only in approximate form. Results from analyses of applications of computationally intensive models serve as examples. The last section presents a practical example intended to illustrate the outstanding role played by uncertainty and sensitivity analysis in the quality assurance of the computer model and of its application.},

To better understand the impact of uncertainty and interaction in the high-dimensional parameter spaces of these models, the set of procedures termed regional sensitivity analysis has been extended and applied to the groundwater pathway of the MMSOILS model. The extension consists of a tree-structured density estimation technique which allows the characterization of complex interaction in that portion of the parameter space which gives rise to successful simulation. Results show that the parameter space can be partitioned into small, densely populated regions and relatively large, sparsely populated regions. From the high-density regions one can identify the important or controlling parameters as well as the interaction between parameters in different local areas of the space. This new tool can provide guidance in the analysis and interpretation of site-specific application of these complex models.},

  abstract = {We describe an approach for calibrating a two-dimensional (2-D) flow model of hyporheic exchange using observations of temperature and pressure to estimate hydraulic and thermal properties. A longitudinal 2-D heat and flow model was constructed for a riffle-pool sequence to simulate flow paths and flux rates for variable discharge conditions. A uniform random sampling approach was used to examine the solution space and identify optimal values at local and regional scales. We used a regional sensitivity analysis to examine the effects of parameter correlation and nonuniqueness commonly encountered in multidimensional modeling. The results from this study demonstrate the ability to estimate hydraulic and thermal parameters using measurements of temperature and pressure to simulate exchange and flow paths. Examination of the local parameter space provides the potential for refinement of zones that are used to represent sediment heterogeneity within the model. The results indicate vertical hydraulic conductivity was not identifiable solely using pressure observations; however, a distinct minimum was identified using temperature observations. The measured temperature and pressure and estimated vertical hydraulic conductivity values indicate the presence of a discontinuous low-permeability deposit that limits the vertical penetration of seepage beneath the riffle, whereas there is a much greater exchange where the low-permeability deposit is absent. Using both temperature and pressure to constrain the parameter estimation process provides the lowest overall root-mean-square error as compared to using solely temperature or pressure observations. This study demonstrates the benefits of combining continuous temperature and pressure for simulating hyporheic exchange and flow in a riffle-pool sequence.},

  title = {Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning},
  volume = {14},
  abstract = {Gaussian processes (GPs) are natural generalisations of multivariate Gaussian random variables to infinite (countably or continuous) index sets. GPs have been applied in a large number of fields to a diverse range of ends, and very many deep theoretical analyses of various properties are available. This paper gives an introduction to Gaussian processes on a fairly elementary level with special emphasis on characteristics relevant in machine learning. It draws explicit connections to branches such as spline smoothing models and support vector machines in which similar ideas have been investigated. Gaussian process models are routinely used to solve hard machine learning problems. They are attractive because of their flexible non-parametric nature and computational simplicity. Treated within a Bayesian framework, very powerful statistical methods can be implemented which offer valid estimates of uncertainties in our predictions and generic model selection procedures cast as nonlinear optimization problems. Their main drawback of heavy computational scaling has recently been alleviated by the introduction of generic sparse approximations.13,78,31 The mathematical literature on GPs is large and often uses deep concepts which are not required to fully understand most machine learning applications. In this tutorial paper, we aim to present characteristics of GPs relevant to machine learning and to show up precise connections to other "kernel machines" popular in the community. Our focus is on a simple presentation, but references to more detailed sources are provided.},

The contribution of this paper is a generic architecture that ensures responsiveness of the application even when dealing with large data and that is applicable to most types of information visualizations. Our architecture builds on the separation of the main application thread and the visualization thread, which can be cancelled early due to user interaction. In combination with a layer mechanism, our architecture facilitates generating previews incrementally to provide rich visual feedback quickly. To help avoiding common pitfalls of multi-threading, we discuss synchronization and communication in detail. We explicitly denote design choices to control trade-offs. A quantitative evaluation based on the system VI S P L ORE shows fast visual feedback during continuous interaction even for millions of entries.

  volume = {18},
  abstract = {Topological techniques have proven highly successful in analyzing and visualizing scientific data. As a result, significant efforts have been made to compute structures like the Morse-Smale complex as robustly and efficiently as possible. However, the resulting algorithms, while topologically consistent, often produce incorrect connectivity as well as poor geometry. These problems may compromise or even invalidate any subsequent analysis. Moreover, such techniques may fail to improve even when the resolution of the domain mesh is increased, thus producing potentially incorrect results even for highly resolved functions. To address these problems we introduce two new algorithms: (i) a randomized algorithm to compute the discrete gradient of a scalar field that converges under refinement; and (ii) a deterministic variant which directly computes accurate geometry and thus correct connectivity of the MS complex. The first algorithm converges in the sense that on average it produces the correct result and its standard deviation approaches zero with increasing mesh resolution. The second algorithm uses two ordered traversals of the function to integrate the probabilities of the first to extract correct (near optimal) geometry and connectivity. We present an extensive empirical study using both synthetic and real-world data and demonstrates the advantages of our algorithms in comparison with several popular approaches. View full abstract},

Cleveland proposes an optimization technique for computing the aspect ratio such that the average absolute orientation of line segments in the chart is equal to 45 degrees. This technique, called banking to 45 degrees, is designed to maximize the discriminability of the orientations of the line segments in the chart. In this paper, we revisit this classic result and describe two new extensions. First, we propose alternate optimization criteria designed to further improve the visual perception of line segment orientations. Second, we develop multi-scale banking, a technique that combines spectral analysis with banking to 45 degrees. Our technique automatically identifies trends at various frequency scales and then generates a banked chart for each of these scales. We demonstrate the utility of our techniques in a range of visualization tools and analysis examples.},

Stimuli were presented both aurally and visually, controlling for all known visual influences on pupil diameter. The patterns of dilation were similar for both aural and visual presentation for all three tasks, but the magnitudes of pupil response were greater for aural presentation. Accuracy was higher for visual presentation for mental arithmetic and digit recall. The findings can be accounted for in terms of dual codes in working memory and suggest that cognitive load is lower for visual than for aural presentation.},

  volume = {18},
  abstract = {Abstract\&amp;\#8212;In this paper, we enable interactive volumetric global illumination by extending photon mapping techniques to handle interactive transfer function (TF) and material editing in the context of volume rendering. We propose novel algorithms and data structures for finding and evaluating parts of a scene affected by these parameter changes, and thus support efficient updates of the photon map. In direct volume rendering (DVR) the ability to explore volume data using parameter changes, such as editable TFs, is of key importance. Advanced global illumination techniques are in most cases computationally too expensive, as they prevent the desired interactivity. Our technique decreases the amount of computation caused by parameter changes, by introducing Historygrams which allow us to efficiently reuse previously computed photon media interactions. Along the viewing rays, we utilize properties of the light transport equations to subdivide a view-ray into segments and independently update them when invalid. Unlike segments of a view-ray, photon scattering events within the volumetric medium needs to be sequentially updated. Using our Historygram approach, we can identify the first invalid photon interaction caused by a property change, and thus reuse all valid photon interactions. Combining these two novel concepts, supports interactive editing of parameters when using volumetric photon mapping in the context of DVR. As a consequence, we can handle arbitrarily shaped and positioned light sources, arbitrary phase functions, bidirectional reflectance distribution functions and multiple scattering which has previously not been possible in interactive DVR.

More recently, recognition that reasoning in science is probabilistic generated intense debate about whether and how it should be constrained so as to ensure the practical certainty of the conclusions drawn. These debates brought to light issues of a philosophical nature which form the core of many scientific controversies today. Scientific Method: A Historical and Philosophical Introduction presents these debates through clear and comparative discussion of key figures in the history of science. Key chapters critically discuss* Galileo's demonstrative method, Bacon's inductive method, and Newton's rules of reasoning* the rise of probabilistic `Bayesian' methods in the eighteenth century* the method of hypotheses through the work of Herschel, Mill and Whewell* the conventionalist views of Poincar{\'e} and Duhem* the inductivism of Peirce, Russell and Keynes* Popper's falsification compared with Reichenbach's enumerative induction* Carnap's scientific method as Bayesian reasoningThe debates are brought up to date in the final chapters by considering the ways in which ideas about method in the physical and biological sciences have affected thinking about method in the social sciences. This debate is analyzed through the ideas of key theorists such as Kuhn, Lakatos, and Feyerabend.},

In this paper we evaluate visualization techniques that enable the diagnosis of coronary artery disease. A key physical quantity of medical interest is endothelial shear stress (ESS). Low ESS has been associated with sites of lesion formation and rapid progression of disease in the coronary arteries. Having effective visualizations of a patient's ESS data is vital for the quick and thorough non-invasive evaluation by a cardiologist. We present a task taxonomy for hemodynamics based on a formative user study with domain experts. Based on the results of this study we developed HemoVis, an interactive visualization application for heart disease diagnosis that uses a novel 2D tree diagram representation of coronary artery trees. We present the results of a formal quantitative user study with domain experts that evaluates the effect of 2D versus 3D artery representations and of color maps on identifying regions of low ESS. We show statistically significant results demonstrating that our 2D visualizations are more accurate and efficient than 3D representations, and that a perceptually appropriate color map leads to fewer diagnostic mistakes than a rainbow color map.},

However, the automated generation of Euler diagrams has never been easy: given an abstract description of a required Euler diagram, it is computationally expensive to generate the diagram. Moreover, the generated diagrams represent sets by polygons, sometimes with quite irregular shapes which make the diagrams less comprehensible. In this paper we address these two issues by developing the theory of piercings, where we define single piercing curves and double piercing curves. We prove that if a diagram can be built inductively by successively adding piercing curves under certain constraints then it can be drawn with circles, which are more aesthetically pleasing than arbitrary polygons. The theory of piercings is developed at the abstract level. In addition, we present a Java implementation that, given an inductively pierced abstract description, generates an Euler diagram consisting only of circles within polynomial time.},

Previous approaches for automatically selecting the aspect ratio have been based on adjusting the orientations or angles of the line segments in the plot. In contrast, we recommend a simple, effective method for selecting the aspect ratio: minimize the arc length of the data curve while keeping the area of the plot constant. The approach is parameterization invariant, robust to a wide range of inputs, preserves visual symmetries in the data, and is a compromise between previously proposed techniques. Further, we demonstrate that it can be effectively used to select the aspect ratio of contour plots. We believe arc length should become the default aspect ratio selection method.},

  title = {Representative {{Factor Generation}} for the {{Interactive Visual Analysis}} of {{High}}-{{Dimensional Data}}},
  volume = {18},
  abstract = {Datasets with a large number of dimensions per data item (hundreds or more) are challenging both for computational and visual analysis. Moreover, these dimensions have different characteristics and relations that result in sub-groups and/or hierarchies over the set of dimensions. Such structures lead to heterogeneity within the dimensions. Although the consideration of these structures is crucial for the analysis, most of the available analysis methods discard the heterogeneous relations among the dimensions. In this paper, we introduce the construction and utilization of representative factors for the interactive visual analysis of structures in high-dimensional datasets. First, we present a selection of methods to investigate the sub-groups in the dimension set and associate representative factors with those groups of dimensions. Second, we introduce how these factors are included in the interactive visual analysis cycle together with the original dimensions. We then provide the steps of an analytical procedure that iteratively analyzes the datasets through the use of representative factors. We discuss how our methods improve the reliability and interpretability of the analysis process by enabling more informed selections of computational tools. Finally, we demonstrate our techniques on the analysis of brain imaging study results that are performed over a large group of subjects. View full abstract},

  abstract = {In this paper we investigate the effects of function composition in the form g(f(x)) = h(x) by means of a spectral analysis of h. We decompose the spectral description of h(x) into a scalar product of the spectral description of g(x) and a term that solely depends on f(x) and that is independent of g(x). We then use the method of stationary phase to derive the essential maximum frequency of g(f(x)) bounding the main portion of the energy of its spectrum. This limit is the product of the maximum frequency of g(x) and the maximum derivative of f(x). This leads to a proper sampling of the composition h of the two functions g and f. We apply our theoretical results to a fundamental open problem in volume rendering-the proper sampling of the rendering integral after the application of a transfer function. In particular, we demonstrate how the sampling criterion can be incorporated in adaptive ray integration, visualization with multi-dimensional transfer functions, and pre-integrated volume rendering.},

However, efficient computation of the MS complex for large scale data remains a challenging problem. We describe a new algorithm and easily extensible framework for computing MS complexes for large scale data of any dimension where scalar values are given at the vertices of a closure-finite and weak topology (CW) complex, therefore enabling computation on a wide variety of meshes such as regular grids, simplicial meshes, and adaptive multiresolution (AMR) meshes. A new divide-and-conquer strategy allows for memory-efficient computation of the MS complex and simplification on-the-fly to control the size of the output. In addition to being able to handle various data formats, the framework supports implementation-specific optimizations, for example, for regular data. We present the complete characterization of critical point cancellations in all dimensions. This technique enables the topology based analysis of large data on off-the-shelf computers. In particular we demonstrate the first full computation of the MS complex for a 1 billion/1024(3) node grid on a laptop computer with 2Gb memory.},

For the parameters or data, for which sensitivities are sought, to appear on the right side, they are converted into artificial variables and set to their actual values, thus obtaining the desired constraints. The method is applicable to linear and nonlinear models, to normal and nonnormal models, and to least squares and other methods of estimation. In addition to its general applicability, the method is also computationally inexpensive, because the necessary information becomes available without extra calculations. The theoretical basis for the method is given and illustrated by its application to least squares, least absolute value, and minimax regression problems and to the estimation of a Weibull distribution from censored data.},

Additionally, throughout the process of multidimensional, multivariate data analysis, uncertainty due to data transformation and integration may split, merge, increase, or decrease. This dynamic characteristic along with other features of uncertainty pose a great challenge to effective uncertainty-aware visualization. This paper presents a new framework for modeling uncertainty and characterizing the evolution of the uncertainty information through analytical processes. Based on the framework, we have designed a visual metaphor called uncertainty flow to visually and intuitively summarize how uncertainty information propagates over the whole analysis pipeline. Our system allows analysts to interact with and analyze the uncertainty information at different levels of detail. Three experiments were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and intuitiveness of our design. View full abstract},

However, in many applications these features involve a range of parameters and decisions that will affect the quality and direction of the analysis. Examples include particular level sets of a specific scalar field, or local inequalities between derived quantities. A critical step in the analysis is to understand how these arbitrary parameters/decisions impact the statistical properties of the features, since such a characterization will help to evaluate the conclusions of the analysis as a whole.},

  abstract = {We present a combinatorial algorithm for the general topological simplification of scalar fields on surfaces. Given a scalar field \&amp;\#402;, our algorithm generates a simplified field g that provably admits only critical points from a constrained subset of the singularities of \&amp;\#402;, while guaranteeing a small distance ||\&amp;\#402; - g||\&amp;\#8734; for data-fitting purpose. In contrast to previous algorithms, our approach is oblivious to the strategy used for selecting features of interest and allows critical points to be removed arbitrarily. When topological persistence is used to select the features of interest, our algorithm produces a standard \&amp;\#8714;-simplification. Our approach is based on a new iterative algorithm for the constrained reconstruction of sub- and sur-level sets. Extensive experiments show that the number of iterations required for our algorithm to converge is rarely greater than 2 and never greater than 5, yielding O(n log(n)) practical time performances. The algorithm handles triangulated surfaces with or without boundary and is robust to the presence of multi-saddles in the input. It is simple to implement, fast in practice and more general than previous techniques. Practically, our approach allows a user to arbitrarily simplify the topology of an input function and robustly generate the corresponding simplified function. An appealing application area of our algorithm is in scalar field design since it enables, without any threshold parameter, the robust pruning of topological noise as selected by the user. This is needed for example to get rid of inaccuracies introduced by numerical solvers, thereby providing topological guarantees needed for certified geometry processing. Experiments show this ability to eliminate numerical noise as well as validate the time efficiency and accuracy of our algorithm. We provide a lightweight C++ implementation as supplemental material that can be used for topological clean- ng on surface meshes. View full abstract},

  isbn = {978-0-309-25634-6},
  abstract = {Advances in computing hardware and algorithms have dramatically improved the ability to simulate complex processes computationally. Today's simulation capabilities offer the prospect of addressing questions that in the past could be addressed only by resource-intensive experimentation, if at all. Assessing the Reliability of Complex Models recognizes the ubiquity of uncertainty in computational estimates of reality and the necessity for its quantification. As computational science and engineering have matured, the process of quantifying or bounding uncertainties in a computational estimate of a physical quality of interest has evolved into a small set of interdependent tasks: verification, validation, and uncertainty of quantification (VVUQ). In recognition of the increasing importance of computational simulation and the increasing need to assess uncertainties in computational results, the National Research Council was asked to study the mathematical foundations of VVUQ and to recommend steps that will ultimately lead to improved processes. Assessing the Reliability of Complex Models discusses changes in education of professionals and dissemination of information that should enhance the ability of future VVUQ practitioners to improve and properly apply VVUQ methodologies to difficult problems, enhance the ability of VVUQ customers to understand VVUQ results and use them to make informed decisions, and enhance the ability of all VVUQ stakeholders to communicate with each other. This report is an essential resource for all decision and policy makers in the field, students, stakeholders, UQ experts, and VVUQ educators and practitioners.},

  volume = {18},
  abstract = {This paper reports on a between-subject, comparative online study of three information visualization demonstrators that each displayed the same dataset by way of an identical scatterplot technique, yet were different in style in terms of visual and interactive embellishment. We validated stylistic adherence and integrity through a separate experiment in which a small cohort of participants assigned our three demonstrators to predefined groups of stylistic examples, after which they described the styles with their own words. From the online study, we discovered significant differences in how participants execute specific interaction operations, and the types of insights that followed from them. However, in spite of significant differences in apparent usability, enjoyability and usefulness between the style demonstrators, no variation was found on the self-reported depth, expert-rated depth, confidence or difficulty of the resulting insights. Three different methods of insight analysis have been applied, revealing how style impacts the creation of insights, ranging from higher-level pattern seeking to a more reflective and interpretative engagement with content, which is what underlies the patterns. As this study only forms the first step in determining how the impact of style in information visualization could be best evaluated, we propose several guidelines and tips on how to gather, compare and categorize insights through an online evaluation study, particularly in terms of analyzing the concise, yet wide variety of insights and observations in a trustworthy and reproducable manner.

  abstract = {Volumetric datasets obtained from scientific simulation and partial differential equation solvers are typically given in the form of non-rectilinear grids. The splatting technique is a popular direct volume rendering algorithm, which can provide high quality ren- dering results, but has been mainly described for rectilinear grids. In splatting, each voxel is represented by a 3D kernel weighted by the discrete voxel value. While the 3D reconstruction kernels for rectilinear grids can be easily constructed based on the distance among the aligned voxels, for irregular grids the kernel construction is significantly more complicated. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on a 3D Delaunay triangulation to create 3D elliptical Gaussian kernels, which then can be used by a splatting algorithm for the rendering of irregular grids. Our method does not require a resampling of the irregular grid. Instead, we use a weighted least squares method to fit a 3D elliptical Gaussian centered at each grid point, approximating its Voronoi cell. The resulting 3D elliptical Gaussians are represented using a convenient matrix representation, which allows them to be seamlessly incorporated into our elliptical splatting rendering system.},

  title = {Texture-Based Visualization of Uncertainty in Flow Fields},
  abstract = {In this paper, we present two novel texture-based techniques to visualize uncertainty in time-dependent 2D flow fields. Both methods use semi-Lagrangian texture advection to show flow direction by streaklines and convey uncertainty by blurring these streaklines. The first approach applies a cross advection perpendicular to the flow direction. The second method employs isotropic diffusion that can be implemented by Gaussian filtering. Both methods are derived from a generic filtering process that is incorporated into the traditional texture advection pipeline. Our visualization methods allow for a continuous change of the density of flow representation by adapting the density of particle injection. All methods can be mapped to efficient GPU implementations. Therefore, the user can interactively control all important characteristics of the system like particle density, error influence, or dye injection to create meaningful illustrations of the underlying uncertainty. Even though there are many sources of uncertainties, we focus on uncertainty that occurs during data acquisition. We demonstrate the usefulness of our methods for the example of real-world fluid flow data measured with the particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique. Furthermore, we compare these techniques with an adapted multi-frequency noise approach. View full abstract},

  title = {{{SeiVis}}: {{An Interactive Visual Subsurface Modeling Application}}},
  volume = {18},
  abstract = {The most important resources to fulfill today\&amp;\#8217;s energy demands are fossil fuels, such as oil and natural gas. When exploiting hydrocarbon reservoirs, a detailed and credible model of the subsurface structures is crucial in order to minimize economic and ecological risks. Creating such a model is an inverse problem: reconstructing structures from measured reflection seismics. The major challenge here is twofold: First, the structures in highly ambiguous seismic data are interpreted in the time domain. Second, a velocity model has to be built from this interpretation to match the model to depth measurements from wells. If it is not possible to obtain a match at all positions, the interpretation has to be updated, going back to the first step. This results in a lengthy back and forth between the different steps, or in an unphysical velocity model in many cases. This paper presents a novel, integrated approach to interactively creating subsurface models from reflection seismics. It integrates the interpretation of the seismic data using an interactive horizon extraction technique based on piecewise global optimization with velocity modeling. Computing and visualizing the effects of changes to the interpretation and velocity model on the depth-converted model on the fly enables an integrated feedback loop that enables a completely new connection of the seismic data in time domain and well data in depth domain. Using a novel joint time/depth visualization, depicting side-by-side views of the original and the resulting depth-converted data, domain experts can directly fit their interpretation in time domain to spatial ground truth data. We have conducted a domain expert evaluation, which illustrates that the presented workflow enables the creation of exact subsurface models much more rapidly than previous approaches.

For that reason, the visualization of uncertainty received a lot of attention, especially in recent years. In the majority of cases, Gaussian distributions are used to describe uncertain behavior, because they are able to model many phenomena encountered in science. Therefore, in most applications uncertain data is (or is assumed to be) Gaussian distributed. If such uncertain data is given on fixed positions, the question of interpolation arises for many visualization approaches. In this paper, we analyze the effects of the usual linear interpolation schemes for visualization of Gaussian distributed data. In addition, we demonstrate that methods known in geostatistics and machine learning have favorable properties for visualization purposes in this case. View full abstract},

These graphs ser ve as a form of dynamic knowledge representation of the biological system being studied and evolve as new insight is gained from the experimental data. While numerous graph layout and drawing packages are available, these tools did not fully meet the needs of our immunologist collaborators. In this paper, we describe the data information display needs of these immunologists and translate them into design decisions. These decisions led us to create Cerebral, a system that uses a biologically guided graph layout and incorporates experimental data directly into the graph display. Small multiple views of different experimental conditions and a data-driven parallel coordinates view enable correlations between experimental conditions to be analyzed at the same time that the data is viewed in the graph context. This combination of coordinated views allows the biologist to view the data from many different perspectives simultaneously. To illustrate the typical analysis tasks performed, we analyze two datasets using Cerebral. Based on feedback from our collaborators we conclude that Cerebral is a valuable tool for analyzing experimental data in the context of an interaction graph model.},

  abstract = {We introduce a flexible technique for interactive exploration of vector field data through classification derived from user-specified feature templates. Our method is founded on the observation that, while similar features within the vector field may be spatially disparate, they share similar neighborhood characteristics. Users generate feature-based visualizations by interactively highlighting well-accepted and domain specific representative feature points. Feature exploration begins with the computation of attributes that describe the neighborhood of each sample within the input vector field. Compilation of these attributes forms a representation of the vector field samples in the attribute space. We project the attribute points onto the canonical 2D plane to enable interactive exploration of the vector field using a painting interface. The projection encodes the similarities between vector field points within the distances computed between their associated attribute points. The proposed method is performed at interactive rates for enhanced user experience and is completely flexible as showcased by the simultaneous identification of diverse feature types.},

We show that the D3bQ15 lattice defined by a 15 neighborhood connectivity of the BCC lattice is not only capable of more accurately discretizing the velocity space of the continuous Boltzmann equation as compared to the D3Q15 Cartesian lattice, it also achieves a comparable spatial discretization with 30 percent less samples. We validate the accuracy of our proposed lattice by investigating its performance on the 3D lid-driven cavity flow problem and show that the D3bQ15 lattice offers significant cost savings while maintaining a comparable accuracy. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method and the impact on graphics and visualization techniques via the application of line-integral convolution on 2D slices as well as the extraction of streamlines of the 3D flow. We further study the benefits of our proposed lattice by applying it to the problem of simulating smoke and show that the D3bQ15 lattice yields more detail and turbulence at a reduced computational cost.},

  title = {Algorithms for {{Labeling Focus Regions}}},
  volume = {18},
  abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the problem of labeling point sites in focus regions of maps or diagrams. This problem occurs, for example, when the user of a mapping service wants to see the names of restaurants or other POIs in a crowded downtown area but keep the overview over a larger area. Our approach is to place the labels at the boundary of the focus region and connect each site with its label by a linear connection, which is called a leader. In this way, we move labels from the focus region to the less valuable context region surrounding it. In order to make the leader layout well readable, we present algorithms that rule out crossings between leaders and optimize other characteristics such as total leader length and distance between labels. This yields a new variant of the boundary labeling problem, which has been studied in the literature. Other than in traditional boundary labeling, where leaders are usually schematized polylines, we focus on leaders that are either straight-line segments or B{\^A}' ezier curves. Further, we present algorithms that, given the sites, find a position of the focus region that optimizes the above characteristics. We also consider a variant of the problem where we have more sites than space for labels. In this situation, we assume that the sites are prioritized by the user. Alternatively, we take a new facility-location perspective which yields a clustering of the sites. We label one representative of each cluster. If the user wishes, we apply our approach to the sites within a cluster, giving details on demand. View full abstract},

  volume = {18},
  abstract = {We present a novel technique\&amp;\#8212;Compressed Adjacency Matrices\&amp;\#8212;for visualizing gene regulatory networks. These directed networks have strong structural characteristics: out-degrees with a scale-free distribution, in-degrees bound by a low maximum, and few and small cycles. Standard visualization techniques, such as node-link diagrams and adjacency matrices, are impeded by these network characteristics. The scale-free distribution of out-degrees causes a high number of intersecting edges in node-link diagrams. Adjacency matrices become space-inefficient due to the low in-degrees and the resulting sparse network. Compressed adjacency matrices, however, exploit these structural characteristics. By cutting open and rearranging an adjacency matrix, we achieve a compact and neatly-arranged visualization. Compressed adjacency matrices allow for easy detection of subnetworks with a specific structure, so-called motifs, which provide important knowledge about gene regulatory networks to domain experts. We summarize motifs commonly referred to in the literature, and relate them to network analysis tasks common to the visualization domain. We show that a user can easily find the important motifs in compressed adjacency matrices, and that this is hard in standard adjacency matrix and node-link diagrams. We also demonstrate that interaction techniques for standard adjacency matrices can be used for our compressed variant. These techniques include rearrangement clustering, highlighting, and filtering.

However, this has two defects: not all of the properties described converge to the same solution, and the statistics computed are not always invariant under isosurface-preserving transformations. We apply Federer's Coarea Formula from geometric measure theory to explain these discrepancies. We describe an improved substitute for histograms based on weighting with the inverse gradient magnitude, develop a statistical model that is invariant under isosurface-preserving transformations, and argue that this provides a consistent method for algorithm evaluation across multiple datasets based on histogram equalization. We use our corrected formulation to reevaluate recent results on average isosurface complexity, and show evidence that noise is one cause of the discrepancy between the expected figure and the observed one.},

Building on the irradiance caching and radiance caching algorithms, our method leverages temporal coherence by sparse temporal sampling and interpolation of the indirect lighting. In our approach, part of the global illumination solution computed in previous frames is reused in the current frame. Our reusing scheme adapts to the change of incoming radiance by updating the indirect lighting only where there is a significant change. By reusing data in several frames, our method removes the flickering artifacts and yields a significant speedup compared to classical computation in which a new cache is computed for every frame. We also define temporal gradients for smooth temporal interpolation. A key aspect of our method is the absence of any additional complex data structure, making the implementation into any existing renderer based on irradiance and radiance caching straightforward. We describe the implementation of our method using graphics hardware for improved performance.},

Combination between the stringer-pitch and the rib-pitch was optimized based on detailed buckling evaluation and MSC/NASTRAN static analysis using realistic aircraft structural model. The resulting Kriging model provided several solutions with improvements, both in the structural weight and the number of structural components, compared with the baseline design. Furthermore, SOM divided the design space into clusters with specific design features. The acquired design knowledge from the present application has been utilized for the horizontal tail design of Mitsubishi Regional Jet (MRJ).},

Global sensitivity analysis aims to identify the parameters whose uncertainty has the largest impact on the variability of a quantity of interest (output of the model). One of the statistical tools used to quantify the influence of each input variable on the output is the Sobol sensitivity index, which can be estimated using a large sample of evaluations of the output. We propose a variance reduction technique, based on the availability of a fast approximation of the output, which can enable significant computational savings when the output is costly to evaluate.},

In this context the use of metaphors plays an important role since they make complex information easily accessible by using commonly known concepts. In this paper we propose a new metaphor, called "Topological Landscapes," which facilitates understanding the topological structure of scalar functions. The basic idea is to construct a terrain with the same topology as a given dataset and to display the terrain as an easily understood representation of the actual input data. In this projection from an \$n\$-dimensional scalar function to a two-dimensional (2D) model we preserve function values of critical points, the persistence (function span) of topological features, and one possible additional metric property (in our examples volume). By displaying this topologically equivalent landscape together with the original data we harness the natural human proficiency in understanding terrain topography and make complex topological information easily accessible.},

Conserved syntenic blocks are an important biological data abstraction for indicating regions of shared sequences. The goal of this work is to show multiple types of relationships at multiple scales in a way that is visually comprehensible in accordance with known perceptual principles. We present a task analysis for this domain where the fundamental questions asked by biologists can be understood by a characterization of relationships into the four types of proximity/location, size, orientation, and similarity/strength, and the four scales of genome, chromosome, block, and genomic feature. We also propose a new taxonomy of the design space for visually encoding conservation data. We present MizBee, a multiscale synteny browser with the unique property of providing interactive side-by-side views of the data across the range of scales supporting exploration of all of these relationship types. We conclude with case studies from two biologists who used MizBee to augment their previous automatic analysis work flow, providing anecdotal evidence about the efficacy oft he system for the visualization of syntenic data, the analysis of conservation relationships, and the communication of scientific insights.},

  abstract = {Volumetric Subdivision (VS) is a powerful paradigm that enables volumetric sculpting and realistic volume defor- mations that give rise to the concept of ``virtual clay''. In VS, volumes are commonly represented as a space-filling set of deformed polyhedra, which can be further decomposed into a mesh of tetrahedra for rendering. Images can then be generated via tetrahedral projection or raycasting. A current shortcoming in VS-based operations is the need for a very high level of subdivision to represent fine detail in the mesh and to obtain a high-fidelity visualization. However, we have discovered that the subdivision process itself can be closely simulated with radial basis functions (RBFs), making it possible to replace the finer subdivision levels by a coarser aggregation of RBF kernels. This reduction to a simplified assembly of RBFs subsequently enables interactive rendering of volumetric subdivision shapes within a GPU-based volume splatting framework.},

  title = {Automatic {{Tuning}} of {{Spatially Varying Transfer Functions}} for {{Blood Vessel Visualization}}},
  volume = {18},
  abstract = {Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) is commonly used in clinical routine for diagnosing vascular diseases. The procedure involves the injection of a contrast agent into the blood stream to increase the contrast between the blood vessels and the surrounding tissue in the image data. CTA is often visualized with Direct Volume Rendering (DVR) where the enhanced image contrast is important for the construction of Transfer Functions (TFs). For increased efficiency, clinical routine heavily relies on preset TFs to simplify the creation of such visualizations for a physician. In practice, however, TF presets often do not yield optimal images due to variations in mixture concentration of contrast agent in the blood stream. In this paper we propose an automatic, optimizationbased method that shifts TF presets to account for general deviations and local variations of the intensity of contrast enhanced blood vessels. Some of the advantages of this method are the following. It computationally automates large parts of a process that is currently performed manually. It performs the TF shift locally and can thus optimize larger portions of the image than is possible with manual interaction. The method is based on a well known vesselness descriptor in the definition of the optimization criterion. The performance of the method is illustrated by clinically relevant CT angiography datasets displaying both improved structural overviews of vessel trees and improved adaption to local variations of contrast concentration.

  abstract = {It remains challenging for information visualization novices to rapidly construct visualizations during exploratory data analysis. We conducted an exploratory laboratory study in which information visualization novices explored fictitious sales data by communicating visualization specifications to a human mediator, who rapidly constructed the visualizations using commercial visualization software. We found that three activities were central to the iterative visualization construction process: data attribute selection, visual template selection, and visual mapping specification. The major barriers faced by the participants were translating questions into data attributes, designing visual mappings, and interpreting the visualizations. Partial specification was common, and the participants used simple heuristics and preferred visualizations they were already familiar with, such as bar, line and pie charts. We derived abstract models from our observations that describe barriers in the data exploration process and uncovered how information visualization novices think about visualization specifications. Our findings support the need for tools that suggest potential visualizations and support iterative refinement, that provide explanations and help with learning, and that are tightly integrated into tool support for the overall visual analytics process.},

  volume = {16},
  abstract = {The concept of continuous scatterplot (CSP) is a modern visualization technique. The idea is to define a scalar density value based on the map between an n-dimensional spatial domain and an m-dimensional data domain, which describe the CSP space. Usually the data domain is two-dimensional to visually convey the underlying, density coded, data. In this paper we investigate kinds of map-based discontinuities, especially for the practical cases n = m = 2 and n = 3 | m = 2, and we depict relations between them and attributes of the resulting CSP itself. Additionally, we show that discontinuities build critical line structures, and we introduce algorithms to detect them. Further, we introduce a discontinuity-based visualization approach, called contribution map (CM), which establishes a relationship between the CSP's data domain and the number of connected components in the spatial domain. We show that CMs enhance the CSP-based linking brushing interaction. Finally, we apply our approaches to a number of synthetic as well as real data sets.},

This paper presents data-driven high-dimensional scaling (DD-HDS), a nonlinear mapping method that follows the line of multidimensional scaling (MDS) approach, based on the preservation of distances between pairs of data. It improves the performance of existing competitors with respect to the representation of high-dimensional data, in two ways. It introduces (1) a specific weighting of distances between data taking into account the concentration of measure phenomenon and (2) a symmetric handling of short distances in the original and output spaces, avoiding false neighbor representations while still allowing some necessary tears in the original distribution. More precisely, the weighting is set according to the effective distribution of distances in the data set, with the exception of a single user-defined parameter setting the tradeoff between local neighborhood preservation and global mapping. The optimization of the stress criterion designed for the mapping is realized by "force-directed placement" (FDP). The mappings of low- and high-dimensional data sets are presented as illustrations of the features and advantages of the proposed algorithm. The weighting function specific to high-dimensional data and the symmetric handling of short distances can be easily incorporated in most distance preservation-based nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods.},

  abstract = {Knowing how protein sequence maps to function (the ``fitness landscape'') is critical for understanding protein evolution as well as for engineering proteins with new and useful properties. We demonstrate that the protein fitness landscape can be inferred from experimental data, using Gaussian processes, a Bayesian learning technique. Gaussian process landscapes can model various protein sequence properties, including functional status, thermostability, enzyme activity, and ligand binding affinity. Trained on experimental data, these models achieve unrivaled quantitative accuracy. Furthermore, the explicit representation of model uncertainty allows for efficient searches through the vast space of possible sequences. We develop and test two protein sequence design algorithms motivated by Bayesian decision theory. The first one identifies small sets of sequences that are informative about the landscape; the second one identifies optimized sequences by iteratively improving the Gaussian process model in regions of the landscape that are predicted to be optimized. We demonstrate the ability of Gaussian processes to guide the search through protein sequence space by designing, constructing, and testing chimeric cytochrome P450s. These algorithms allowed us to engineer active P450 enzymes that are more thermostable than any previously made by chimeragenesis, rational design, or directed evolution.},

  abstract = {One potential solution to reduce the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is the geologic storage of captured CO2 in underground rock formations, also known as carbon sequestration. There is ongoing research to guarantee that this process is both efficient and safe. We describe tools that provide measurements of media porosity, and permeability estimates, including visualization of pore structures. Existing standard algorithms make limited use of geometric information in calculating permeability of complex microstructures. This quantity is important for the analysis of biomineralization, a subsurface process that can affect physical properties of porous media. This paper introduces geometric and topological descriptors that enhance the estimation of material permeability. Our analysis framework includes the processing of experimental data, segmentation, and feature extraction and making novel use of multiscale topological analysis to quantify maximum flow through porous networks. We illustrate our results using synchrotron-based X-ray computed microtomography of glass beads during biomineralization. We also benchmark the proposed algorithms using simulated data sets modeling jammed packed bead beds of a monodispersive material. View full abstract},

  abstract = {Powerful response surface methods based on kriging and radial basis function (RBF) interpolation have been developed for expensive, i.e. computationally costly, global nonconvex optimization. We have implemented some of these methods in the solvers rbfSolve and EGO in the TOMLAB Optimization Environment ( http://www.tomopt.com/tomlab/ ). In this paper we study algorithms based on RBF interpolation. The practical performance of the RBF algorithm is sensitive to the initial experimental design, and to the static choice of target values. A new adaptive radial basis interpolation (ARBF) algorithm, suitable for parallel implementation, is presented. The algorithm is described in detail and its efficiency is analyzed on the standard test problem set of Dixon\textemdash{}Szeg{\"o}. Results show that it outperforms the published results of rbfSolve and several other solvers.},

  title = {Fast {{Implementation}} of {{Color Constancy Algorithms}}},
  abstract = {Color constancy is a feature of the human color perception system which ensures that the perceived color of objects remains relatively constant under varying illumination conditions, and therefore closer to the physical reflectance. This perceptual effect, discovered by Helmholtz, was formalized by Land and McCann in 1971, who formulated the Retinex theory. Several theories have ever since been developed, known as Retinex or color constancy algorithms. In particular an important historic variant was proposed by Horn in 1974 and another by Blake in 1985. These algorithms modify the RGB values at each pixel in an attempt to give an estimate of the physical color. Land's original algorithm is both complex and not fully specified. It computes at each pixel a stochastic integral on an unspecified set of paths on the image. For this reason, Land's algorithm has received many recent interpretations and implementations that attempt to tune down the excessive complexity. In this paper, a fast and exact FFT implementation of Land's, Horn and Blake theories is described. It permits for the first time a rigorous comparison of these algorithms. A slight variant of these three algorithms will be proposed, that makes them into contrast enhancing algorithms. Several comparative experiments on color images illustrate the superiority of Land's model to manipulate image contrast.},

  volume = {18},
  abstract = {The performance of massively parallel applications is often heavily impacted by the cost of communication among compute nodes. However, determining how to best use the network is a formidable task, made challenging by the ever increasing size and complexity of modern supercomputers. This paper applies visualization techniques to aid parallel application developers in understanding the network activity by enabling a detailed exploration of the flow of packets through the hardware interconnect. In order to visualize this large and complex data, we employ two linked views of the hardware network. The first is a 2D view, that represents the network structure as one of several simplified planar projections. This view is designed to allow a user to easily identify trends and patterns in the network traffic. The second is a 3D view that augments the 2D view by preserving the physical network topology and providing a context that is familiar to the application developers. Using the massively parallel multi-physics code pF3D as a case study, we demonstrate that our tool provides valuable insight that we use to explain and optimize pF3D\&amp;\#8217;s performance on an IBM Blue Gene/P system.

By assigning each pixel to the label for which the greatest probability is calculated, a high-quality image segmentation may be obtained. Theoretical properties of this algorithm are developed along with the corresponding connections to discrete potential theory and electrical circuits. This algorithm is formulated in discrete space (i.e., on a graph) using combinatorial analogues of standard operators and principles from continuous potential theory, allowing it to be applied in arbitrary dimension on arbitrary graphs.},

When performing such analysis, a genetic likelihood space is generated and sampled, which results in a multidimensional scalar field. Researchers are interested in exploring this likelihood space through the use of visualization. Previous efforts at visualizing this space, though, were slow and cumbersome, only showing a small portion of the space at a time, thus requiring the user to keep a mental picture of several views. We have developed a new technique that displays much more data at once by projecting the multidimensional data into several 2D plots. One plot is created for each parameter that shows the change along that parameter. A radial projection is used to create another plot that provides an overview of the high dimensional surface from the perspective of a single point. Linking and brushing between all the plots are used to determine relationships between parameters. We demonstrate our techniques on real world autism data, showing how to visually examine features of the high dimensional space.},

Our method is integral in nature and uses convolved covariance matrices of Voronoi cells of the point cloud which makes it provably robust in the presence of noise. We show that these matrices contain information related to curvature in the smooth parts of the surface, and information about the directions and angles of sharp edges around the features of a piecewise-smooth surface. Our method is applicable in both two and three dimensions, and can be easily parallelized, making it possible to process arbitrarily large point clouds, which was a challenge for Voronoi-based methods. In addition, we describe a Monte-Carlo version of our method, which is applicable in any dimension. We illustrate the correctness of both principal curvature information and feature extraction in the presence of varying levels of noise and sampling density on a variety of models. As a sample application, we use our feature detection method to segment point cloud samplings of piecewise-smooth surfaces.},

Fixing these parameters over a set of images assumes the same parameters are ideal for each image. We highlight the effects of varying the parameters and initialization on segmentation accuracy and propose a framework for attaining improved results using image adaptive parameters and initializations. We provide an analytical definition of optimal weights for functional terms through an examination of segmentation in the context of image manifolds, where nearby images on the manifold require similar parameters and similar initializations. Our results validate that fixed parameters are insufficient in addressing the variability in real clinical data, that similar images require similar parameters, and demonstrate how these parameters correlate with the image manifold. We present significantly improved segmentations for synthetic images and a set of 470 clinical examples.},

Error-prone observations may lead to biased estimation and loss of power in detecting the impact of explanatory variables on the response. We consider misclassified binary exposure in the context of case-control studies, assuming the availability of validation data to inform the magnitude of the misclassification. A Bayesian adjustment to correct the misclassification is investigated. Simulation studies show that the Bayesian method can have advantages over non-Bayesian counterparts, particularly in the face of a rare exposure, small validation sample sizes, and uncertainty about whether exposure misclassification is differential or non-differential.

  title = {Point-Based Probabilistic Surfaces to Show Surface Uncertainty.},
  volume = {10},
  abstract = {Efficient and informative visualization of surfaces with uncertainties is an important topic with many applications in science and engineering. In these applications, the correct course of action may depend not only on the location of a boundary, but on the precision with which that location is known. Examples include environmental pollution borderline detection, oil basin edge characterization, or discrimination between cancerous and healthy tissue in medicine. This paper presents a method for producing visualizations of surfaces with uncertainties using points as display primitives. Our approach is to render the surface as a collection of points and to displace each point from its original location along the surface normal by an amount proportional to the uncertainty at that point. This approaoh can be used in combination with other techniques such as pseudocoloring to produce efficient and revealing visualizations. The basic approach is sufficiently flexible to allow natural extensions; we show incorporation of expressive modulation of opacity, change of the stroke primitive, and addition of an underlying polygonal model. The method is used to visualize real and simulated tumor formations with uncertainty of tumor boundaries. The point-based technique is compared to pseudocoloring for a position estimation task in a preliminary user study.},

  title = {Interaction {{Support}} for {{Visual Comparison Inspired}} by {{Natural Behavior}}},
  volume = {18},
  abstract = {Visual comparison is an intrinsic part of interactive data exploration and analysis. The literature provides a large body of existing solutions that help users accomplish comparison tasks. These solutions are mostly of visual nature and custom-made for specific data. We ask the question if a more general support is possible by focusing on the interaction aspect of comparison tasks. As an answer to this question, we propose a novel interaction concept that is inspired by real-world behavior of people comparing information printed on paper. In line with real-world interaction, our approach supports users (1) in interactively specifying pieces of graphical information to be compared, (2) in flexibly arranging these pieces on the screen, and (3) in performing the actual comparison of side-by-side and overlapping arrangements of the graphical information. Complementary visual cues and add-ons further assist users in carrying out comparison tasks. Our concept and the integrated interaction techniques are generally applicable and can be coupled with different visualization techniques. We implemented an interactive prototype and conducted a qualitative user study to assess the concept\&amp;\#8217;s usefulness in the context of three different visualization techniques. The obtained feedback indicates that our interaction techniques mimic the natural behavior quite well, can be learned quickly, and are easy to apply to visual comparison tasks. View full abstract},

  abstract = {Gaussian process (GP) models are non-parametric, black-box models that represent a new method for system identification. The optimization of GP models, due to their probabilistic nature, is based on maximization of the probability of the model. This probability can be calculated by the marginal likelihood. Commonly used approaches for maximizing the marginal likelihood of GP models are the deterministic optimization methods. However, their success critically depends on the initial values. In addition, the marginal likelihood function often has a lot of local minima in which the deterministic method can be trapped. Therefore, stochastic optimization methods can be considered as an alternative approach. In this paper we test their applicability in GP model optimization. We performed a comparative study of three stochastic algorithms: the genetic algorithm, differential evolution, and particle swarm optimization. Empirical tests were carried out on a benchmark problem of modeling the concentration of CO 2 in the atmosphere. The results indicate that with proper tuning differential evolution and particle swarm optimization significantly outperform the conjugate gradient method.},

In this paper we present a semi-automatic approach to this problem that works by visually segmenting the intensitygradient 2D histogram of a volumetric dataset into an exploration hierarchy. Our approach mimics user exploration behavior by analyzing the histogram with the normalized-cut multilevel segmentation technique. Unlike previous work in this area, our technique segments the histogram into a reasonable set of intuitive components that are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive. We use information-theoretic measures of the volumetric data segments to guide the exploration. This provides a data-driven coarse-to-fine hierarchy for a user to interactively navigate the volume in a meaningful manner. View full abstract},

  abstract = {A global sensitivity analysis with regional properties is introduced. This method is demonstrated on two synthetic and one hydraulic example. It can be shown that an uncertainty analysis based on one-dimensional scatter plots and correlation analyses such as the Spearman Rank Correlation coefficient can lead to misinterpretations of any model results. The method which has been proposed in this paper is based on multiple regression trees (so called Random Forests). The splits at each node of the regression tree are sampled from a probability distribution. Several criteria are enforced at each level of splitting to ensure positive information gain and also to distinguish between behavioural and non-behavioural model representations. The latter distinction is applied in the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) and regional sensitivity analysis (RSA) framework to analyse model results and is used here to derive regression tree (model) structures. Two methods of sensitivity analysis are used: in the first method the total information gain achieved by each parameter is evaluated. In the second method parameters and parameter sets are permuted and an error rate computed. This error rate is compared to values without permutation. This latter method allows the evaluation of the sensitivity of parameter combinations and thus gives an insight into the structure of the response surface. The examples demonstrate the capability of this methodology and stress the importance of the application of sensitivity analysis.},

  abstract = {Natural Interaction is a key requirement for the virtual validation of functional aspects in automotive product development processes. It is the metaphor people encounter in reality: the direct manipulation of objects by their hands. To enable this kind of interaction, we propose a pseudo-physical metaphor that is plausible enough to provide realistic interaction and robust enough to meet the needs of industrial applications. Our analysis of the most common object types in automotive scenarios guided the development of a set of grasping heuristics to support robust finger-based interaction of multiple hands and users. The objects' reaction to the users' finger motions is based on pseudo-physical simulations, also taking various types of constrained objects into account. In dealing with real-world scenarios, we had to introduce Normal Proxies, which extend objects with appropriate normals for improved grasp detection. An expert review revealed that our metaphors allow for an intuitive and reliable assessment of several functionalities of objects found in a car interior. Follow-up user studies showed that overall task performance and usability are similar for CAVE- and HMD-environments. For larger objects and more gross manipulation, using the CAVE without employing a virtual hand representation is preferred, but for more fine-grained manipulation and smaller objects the HMD turns out to be beneficial.},

  volume = {31},
  issn = {0925-5001},
  abstract = {We present a new strategy for the constrained global optimization of expensive black box functions using response surface models. A response surface model is simply a multivariate approximation of a continuous black box function which is used as a surrogate model for optimization in situations where function evaluations are computationally expensive. Prior global optimization methods that utilize response surface models were limited to box-constrained problems, but the new method can easily incorporate general nonlinear constraints. In the proposed method, which we refer to as the Constrained Optimization using Response Surfaces (CORS) Method, the next point for costly function evaluation is chosen to be the one that minimizes the current response surface model subject to the given constraints and to additional constraints that the point be of some distance from previously evaluated points. The distance requirement is allowed to cycle, starting from a high value (global search) and ending with a low value (local search). The purpose of the constraint is to drive the method towards unexplored regions of the domain and to prevent the premature convergence of the method to some point which may not even be a local minimizer of the black box function. The new method can be shown to converge to the global minimizer of any continuous function on a compact set regardless of the response surface model that is used. Finally, we considered two particular implementations of the CORS method which utilize a radial basis function model (CORS-RBF) and applied it on the box-constrained Dixon\textendash{}Szeg{\"o} test functions and on a simple nonlinearly constrained test function. The results indicate that the CORS-RBF algorithms are competitive with existing global optimization algorithms for costly functions on the box-constrained test problems. The results also show that the CORS-RBF algorithms are better than other algorithms for constrained global optimization on the nonlinearly constrained test problem.},

In addition to blur, dashing and grayscale, we investigate the use of \&amp;\#8216;sketchiness\&amp;\#8217; as a visual variable because it conveys visual impreciseness that may be associated with data quality. Inspired by work in non-photorealistic rendering and by the features of hand-drawn lines, we generate line trajectories that resemble hand-drawn strokes of various levels of proficiency\&amp;\#8212;ranging from child to adult strokes\&amp;\#8212;where the amount of perturbations in the line corresponds to the level of uncertainty in the data. Our results show that sketchiness is a viable alternative for the visualization of uncertainty in lines and is as intuitive as blur; although people subjectively prefer dashing style over blur, grayscale and sketchiness. We discuss advantages and limitations of each technique and conclude with design considerations on how to deploy these visual variables to effectively depict various levels of uncertainty for line marks.

  abstract = {Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis results obtained with random and Latin hypercube sampling are compared. The comparison uses results from a model for two-phase fluid flow obtained with three independent random samples of size 100 each and three independent Latin hypercube samples (LHSs) of size 100 each. Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis results with the two sampling procedures are similar and stable across the three replicated samples. Poor performance of regression-based sensitivity analysis procedures for some analysis outcomes results more from the inappropriateness of the procedure for the nonlinear relationships between model input and model results than from an inadequate sample size. Kendall's coefficient of concordance (KCC) and the top down coefficient of concordance (TDCC) are used to assess the stability of sensitivity analysis results across replicated samples, with the TDCC providing a more informative measure of analysis stability than KCC. A new sensitivity analysis procedure based on replicated samples and the TDCC is introduced.},

We explore a range of possible feature spaces, including value, gradient, and probabilistic measures, and examine the consequences of including these measures in the feature space. The time and space computational complexity of our segmentation algorithm is O(N), which allows interactive, user-centric segmentation even for large datasets. We show that this method, given appropriate choice of feature vector, produces results both qualitatively and quantitatively similar to Level Sets, Random Walkers, and others. We validate the robustness of this segmentation scheme with comparisons to standard ground-truth models and sensitivity analysis of the algorithm.},

Characterizing design conventions between users and data domains is an important step in developing hypotheses, tools, and design guidelines for information visualization.

Two commonplace presentation types were analyzed: electronic slideshows and whiteboard \&amp;\#8220;chalk talks\&amp;\#8221;. We found design differences in slideshows using two methods - coding and comparing manually-selected features, like charts and diagrams, and an image-based analysis using PCA called eigenslides. In whiteboard talks with controlled topics, we observed design behaviors, including using representations and formalisms from a participant\&amp;\#8217;s own discipline, that suggest authors might benefit from novel assistive tools for designing presentations. Based on these findings, we discuss opportunities for visualization ethnography and human-centered authoring tools for visual information. View full abstract},

  volume = {11},
  abstract = {This study seeks to identify sensitivity tools that will advance our understanding of lumped hydrologic models for the purposes of model improvement, calibration efficiency and improved measurement schemes. Four sensitivity analysis methods were tested: (1) local analysis using parameter estimation software (PEST), (2) regional sensitivity analysis (RSA), (3) analysis of variance (ANOVA), and (4) Sobol's method. The methods' relative efficiencies and effectiveness have been analyzed and compared. These four sensitivity methods were applied to the lumped Sacramento soil moisture accounting model (SAC-SMA) coupled with SNOW-17. Results from this study characterize model sensitivities for two medium sized watersheds within the Juniata River Basin in Pennsylvania, USA. Comparative results for the 4 sensitivity methods are presented for a 3-year time series with 1 h, 6 h, and 24 h time intervals. The results of this study show that model parameter sensitivities are heavily impacted by the choice of analysis method as well as the model time interval. Differences between the two adjacent watersheds also suggest strong influences of local physical characteristics on the sensitivity methods' results. This study also contributes a comprehensive assessment of the repeatability, robustness, efficiency, and ease-of-implementation of the four sensitivity methods. Overall ANOVA and Sobol's method were shown to be superior to RSA and PEST. Relative to one another, ANOVA has reduced computational requirements and Sobol's method yielded more robust sensitivity rankings.},

  abstract = {Direct Volume Rendering has proved to be an effective visualization method for medical data sets and has reached wide-spread clinical use. The diagnostic exploration, in essence, corresponds to a tissue classification task, which is often complex and time-consuming. Moreover, a major problem is the lack of information on the uncertainty of the classification, which can have dramatic consequences for the diagnosis. In this paper this problem is addressed by proposing animation methods to convey uncertainty in the rendering. The foundation is a probabilistic Transfer Function model which allows for direct user interaction with the classification. The rendering is animated by sampling the probability domain over time, which results in varying appearance for uncertain regions. A particularly promising application of this technique is a "sensitivity lens" applied to focus regions in the data set. The methods have been evaluated by radiologists in a study simulating the clinical task of stenosis assessment, in which the animation technique is shown to outperform traditional rendering in terms of assessment accuracy.},

The basic approach of repeatedly extracting isosurfaces, illuminating them, and then building a 3D illumination grid suffers from the non-uniform sampling that arises from coupling the sampling of radiance with the sampling of isosurfaces. We demonstrate how the illumination step can be decoupled from the isosurface extraction step by illuminating the entire 3D scalar function as a 3-manifold in 4-dimensional space. By reformulating light transport in a higher dimension, one can sample a 3D volume without requiring the radiance samples to aggregate along individual isosurfaces in the pre-computed illumination grid.

The accuracy of surface perception can be measured and the influencing factors can be modified in order to decrease the error in perception. This paper presents a novel concept of how a perceptual evaluation of a visualization technique can contribute to its redesign with the aim of improving the match between the distal and the proximal stimulus. During analysis of data from previous perceptual studies, we observed that the slant of 3D surfaces visualized on 2D screens is systematically underestimated. The visible trends in the error allowed us to create a statistical model of the perceived surface slant. Based on this statistical model we obtained from user experiments, we derived a new shading model that uses adjusted surface normals and aims to reduce the error in slant perception. The result is a shape-enhancement of visualization which is driven by an experimentally-founded statistical model. To assess the efficiency of the statistical shading model, we repeated the evaluation experiment and confirmed that the error in perception was decreased. Results of both user experiments are publicly-available datasets. View full abstract},

  abstract = {In this paper we address the following question: Can we approximately sample from a Bayesian posterior distribution if we are only allowed to touch a small mini-batch of data-items for every sample we generate?. An algorithm based on the Langevin equation with stochastic gradients (SGLD) was previously proposed to solve this, but its mixing rate was slow. By leveraging the Bayesian Central Limit Theorem, we extend the SGLD algorithm so that at high mixing rates it will sample from a normal approximation of the posterior, while for slow mixing rates it will mimic the behavior of SGLD with a pre-conditioner matrix. As a bonus, the proposed algorithm is reminiscent of Fisher scoring (with stochastic gradients) and as such an efficient optimizer during burn-in.},

The number of possible representations grows rapidly with the number of dimensions, and manual exploration quickly becomes ineffective or even unfeasible. This paper proposes automatic analysis methods to extract potentially relevant visual structures from a set of candidate visualizations. Based on features, the visualizations are ranked in accordance with a specified user task. The user is provided with a manageable number of potentially useful candidate visualizations, which can be used as a starting point for interactive data analysis. This can effectively ease the task of finding truly useful visualizations and potentially speed up the data exploration task. In this paper, we present ranking measures for class-based as well as non class-based scatterplots and parallel coordinates visualizations. The proposed analysis methods are evaluated on different datasets.},

Researchers interested in better understanding these models have studied the changes in hidden state representations over time and noticed some interpretable patterns but also significant noise. In this work, we present LSTMVis, a visual analysis tool for recurrent neural networks with a focus on understanding these hidden state dynamics. The tool allows users to select a hypothesis input range to focus on local state changes, to match these states changes to similar patterns in a large data set, and to align these results with structural annotations from their domain. We show several use cases of the tool for analyzing specific hidden state properties on dataset containing nesting, phrase structure, and chord progressions, and demonstrate how the tool can be used to isolate patterns for further statistical analysis. We characterize the domain, the different stakeholders, and their goals and tasks. Long-term usage data after putting the tool online revealed great interest in the machine learning community.},

Faculty in instructional technology programs who provide an environment that effectively nourishes these ID skills have a responsibility to continually evaluate and update their instructional methods to ensure that course goals are met. Using students' drawings of their expressed mental models as an assessment tool is one approach that helps evaluate teaching methods, determine what students have learned, and how they have conceptualized important concepts. In this study, teams of instructional technology graduate students in a two-semester, multimedia design and development course used an authoring program to create multimedia projects for real clients. This study examined the cognitive changes that occurred when these students were immersed in a technology-rich, collaborative environment. Comparison of students' visual representations of their mental models of multimedia design and development from the beginning and end of the course provided insight into conceptual changes that occurred in regards to the multimedia course, its goals, and the collaborative process. Analysis of students' drawings of their mental models indicated substantial transformations from linear, individualistic, and skills-based thinking to recursive, collaborative, and team-oriented concepts. This data provides evidence that the visual, graphic nature of mental models provides a coherent, fluid, and detailed representation of students' thinking, one that captures a level of richness that may be missing from essay methods, product assessment, or class evaluations.},

  abstract = {Volumetric datasets obtained from scientific simulation and partial differential equation solvers are typically given in the form of non-rectilinear grids. The splatting technique is a popular direct volume rendering algorithm, which can provide high quality ren- dering results, but has been mainly described for rectilinear grids. In splatting, each voxel is represented by a 3D kernel weighted by the discrete voxel value. While the 3D reconstruction kernels for rectilinear grids can be easily constructed based on the distance among the aligned voxels, for irregular grids the kernel construction is significantly more complicated. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on a 3D Delaunay triangulation to create 3D elliptical Gaussian kernels, which then can be used by a splatting algorithm for the rendering of irregular grids. Our method does not require a resampling of the irregular grid. Instead, we use a weighted least squares method to fit a 3D elliptical Gaussian centered at each grid point, approximating its Voronoi cell. The resulting 3D elliptical Gaussians are represented using a convenient matrix representation, which allows them to be seamlessly incorporated into our elliptical splatting rendering system.},

  abstract = {A common strategy in Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) is to rank alternative solutions by weighted summary scores. Weights, however, are often abstract to the decision maker and can only be set by vague intuition. While previous work supports a point-wise exploration of weight spaces, we argue that MCDM can benefit from a regional and global visual analysis of weight spaces. Our main contribution is WeightLifter, a novel interactive visualization technique for weight-based MCDM that facilitates the exploration of weight spaces with up to ten criteria. Our technique enables users to better understand the sensitivity of a decision to changes of weights, to efficiently localize weight regions where a given solution ranks high, and to filter out solutions which do not rank high enough for any plausible combination of weights. We provide a comprehensive requirement analysis for weight-based MCDM and describe an interactive workflow that meets these requirements. For evaluation, we describe a usage scenario of WeightLifter in automotive engineering and report qualitative feedback from users of a deployed version as well as preliminary feedback from decision makers in multiple domains. This feedback confirms that WeightLifter increases both the efficiency of weight-based MCDM and the awareness of uncertainty in the ultimate decisions.},

Where once a data analyst was forced to make restrictive assumptions before beginning, the power of the computer now allows great freedom in deciding where an analysis should go. One area that has benefited greatly from this new freedom is that of non parametric density, distribution, and regression function estimation, or what are generally called smoothing methods. Most people are familiar with some smoothing methods (such as the histogram) but are unlikely to know about more recent developments that could be useful to them. If a group of experts on statistical smoothing methods are put in a room, two things are likely to happen. First, they will agree that data analysts seriously underappreciate smoothing methods. Smoothing meth- ods use computing power to give analysts the ability to highlight unusual structure very effectively, by taking advantage of people's abilities to draw conclusions from well-designed graphics. Data analysts should take advan- tage of this, they will argue.},

However, how people perceive and interact with a visualization tool can strongly influence their understanding of the data as well as the system's usefulness. Human factors therefore contribute significantly to the visualization process and should play an important role in the design and evaluation of visualization tools. Several research initiatives have begun to explore human factors in visualization, particularly in perception-based design. Nonetheless, visualization work involving human factors is in its infancy, and many potentially promising areas have yet to be explored. Therefore, we aim to 1) review known methodology for doing human factors research, with specific emphasis on visualization, 2) review current human factors research in visualization to provide a basis for future investigation, and 3) identify promising areas for future research.},

This paper presents a new algorithm, called hdoutliers, for detecting multidimensional outliers. It is unique for a) dealing with a mixture of categorical and continuous variables, b) dealing with big-p (many columns of data), c) dealing with big-\$n\$ (many rows of data), d) dealing with outliers that mask other outliers, and e) dealing consistently with unidimensional and multidimensional datasets. Unlike ad hoc methods found in many machine learning papers, hdoutliers is based on a distributional model that allows outliers to be tagged with a probability. This critical feature reduces the likelihood of false discoveries.},

  abstract = {Scatterplots are well established means of visualizing discrete data values with two data variables as a collection of discrete points. We aim at generalizing the concept of scatterplots to the visualization of spatially continuous input data by a continuous and dense plot. An example of a continuous input field is data defined on an n-D spatial grid with respective interpolation or reconstruction of in-between values. We propose a rigorous, accurate, and generic mathematical model of continuous scatterplots that considers an arbitrary density defined on an input field on an n-D domain and that maps this density to m-D scatterplots. Special cases are derived from this generic model and discussed in detail: scatterplots where the n-D spatial domain and the m-D data attribute domain have identical dimension, 1-D scatterplots as a way to define continuous histograms, and 2-D scatterplots of data on 3-D spatial grids. We show how continuous histograms are related to traditional discrete histograms and to the histograms of isosurface statistics. Based on the mathematical model of continuous scatterplots, respective visualization algorithms are derived, in particular for 2-D scatterplots of data from 3-D tetrahedral grids. For several visualization tasks, we show the applicability of continuous scatterplots. Since continuous scatterplots do not only sample data at grid points but interpolate data values within cells, a dense and complete visualization of the data set is achieved that scales well with increasing data set size. Especially for irregular grids with varying cell size, improved results are obtained when compared to conventional scatterplots. Therefore, continuous scatterplots are a suitable extension of a statistics visualization technique to be applied to typical data from scientific computation.},

However DFT simulations result in complex multivariate datasets in which it is difficult to locate the crucial \&amp;\#8216;scission\&amp;\#8217; point at which one nucleus fragments into two, and to identify the precursors to scission. The Joint Contour Net (JCN) has recently been proposed as a new data structure for the topological analysis of multivariate scalar fields, analogous to the contour tree for univariate fields. This paper reports the analysis of DFT simulations using the JCN, the first application of the JCN technique to real data. It makes three contributions to visualization: (i) a set of practical methods for visualizing the JCN, (ii) new insight into the detection of nuclear scission, and (iii) an analysis of aesthetic criteria to drive further work on representing the JCN.

Methods of estimating multivariate densities may therefore be converted to clustering techniques, and clustering techniques may be helpful in estimating multivariate densities. Graphical techniques for representing clusters are closely related to multivariate histograms. Block histograms in two dimensions are constructed by finding a rectangle of minimum area containing a fixed number of points, deleting this rectangle and the points it contains, then finding another rectangle of minimum area containing a fixed number of points and so on. These histograms are simple visual representations of a density estimate in two dimensions. Analogous block histograms in many dimensions are useful but more difficult to represent graphically. A different approach represents each point by a box drawn in three or more dimensions. If the points are first ordered by some other clustering technique, the similarity of neighbouring boxes suggests or denies the presence of clusters.},

In just what sense distances and dissimilarities should correspond has been left rather vague in most approaches, thus leaving these approaches logically incomplete. Our fundamental hypothesis is that dissimilarities and distances are monotonically related. We define a quantitative, intuitively satisfying measure of goodness of fit to this hypothesis. Our technique of multidimensional scaling is to compute that configuration of points which optimizes the goodness of fit. A practical computer program for doing the calculations is described in a companion paper.},

Using VisCareTrails, a data visualization software system based on the principle of timed word trees, we were able to identify five novel behaviors that informed our understanding of how players were approaching the game. We further utilized these newly identified player behaviors by triangulating them with geometry test scores collected from players outside the game setting. We compared the predictive capacity of these behaviors against five demographic characteristics commonly observed to be associated with educational outcomes: age, gender, ethnicity, mother's education, and attitude toward video games. Two of the novel behaviors we identified, both reflecting inflexible problem-solving strategies, outperformed all demographic variables except age in terms of predicting change in geometry test scores post-gameplay. We believe that this is sound evidence for the utility of VisCareTrails and the timed-word-tree method for identifying pedagogically relevant player behaviors from semi-structured data associated with educational games.},

Projections can easily display aspects of structure that are only of low dimension, and sections\textendash{}that is, intersections of subspaces with a high-dimensional object\textendash{}can easily display structure of only low codimension (and hence often high dimension). However, compositions of sections and projections, here called prosections, can display aspects of structure of any intermediate dimension. These statements are relevant for data analysis: projections of data can be easily generated with x-y scatterplots, three-dimensional (3-D) data rotations, and grand tours; sections can be approximated in existing systems by scatterplot brushing and painting. Thus this article is in part an investigation into the principles underlying these techniques.},

  title = {Understanding {{Indirect Causal Relationships}} in {{Node}}-{{Link Graphs}}},
  volume = {36},
  abstract = {Abstract To find correlations and cause and effect relationships in multivariate data sets is central in many data analysis problems. A common way of representing causal relations among variables is to use node-link diagrams, where nodes depict variables and edges show relationships between them. When performing a causal analysis, analysts may be biased by the position of collected evidences, especially when they are at the top of a list. This is of crucial importance since finding a root cause or a derived effect, and searching for causal chains of inferences are essential analytic tasks when investigating causal relationships. In this paper, we examine whether sequential ordering influences understanding of indirect causal relationships and whether it improves readability of multi-attribute causal diagrams. Moreover, we see how people reason to identify a root cause or a derived effect. The results of our design study show that sequential ordering does not play a crucial role when analyzing causal relationships, but many connections from/to a variable and higher strength/certainty values may influence the process of finding a root cause and a derived effect.},

While GPU-based rendering can drastically improve performance, that paradigm has a steep learning curve, usually requiring expertise in the computer graphics pipeline and shader programming. In addition, the recent growth of virtual and augmented reality poses a challenge for supporting multiple display environments beyond regular canvases, such as a Head Mounted Display (HMD) and Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE). In this paper, we introduce a new web-based visualization library called Stardust, which provides a familiar API while leveraging GPU's processing power. Stardust also enables developers to create both 2D and 3D visualizations for diverse display environments using a uniform API. To demonstrate Stardust's expressiveness and portability, we present five example visualizations and a coding playground for four display environments. We also evaluate its performance by comparing it against the standard HTML5 Canvas, D3, and Vega.},

However, such a view is essential for researchers and practitioners seeking to develop systems for broad audiences that span multiple domains. In this paper, we interpret VA research through the lens of Activity Theory (AT) - a framework for modelling human activities that has been influential in the field of Human-Computer Interaction. We first provide an overview of Activity Theory, showing its potential for thinking beyond tasks, representations, and interactions to the broader systems of activity in which interactive tools are embedded and used. Next, we describe how Activity Theory can be used as an organizing framework in the construction of activity typologies, building and expanding upon the tradition of abstract task taxonomies in the field of Information Visualization. We then apply the resulting process to create an activity typology for Visual Analytics, synthesizing a wide range of systems and activity concepts from the literature. Finally, we use this typology as the foundation of an activity-centered design process, highlighting both tensions and opportunities in the design space of VA systems.},

  issn = {1077-2626},
  abstract = {Visualization researchers and practitioners engaged in generating or evaluating designs are faced with the difficult problem of transforming the questions asked and actions taken by target users from domain-specific language and context into more abstract forms. Existing abstract task classifications aim to provide support for this endeavour by providing a carefully delineated suite of actions. Our experience is that this bottom-up approach is part of the challenge: low-level actions are difficult to interpret without a higher-level context of analysis goals and the analysis process. To bridge this gap, we propose a framework based on analysis reports derived from open-coding 20 design study papers published at IEEE InfoVis 2009-2015, to build on the previous work of abstractions that collectively encompass a broad variety of domains. The framework is organized in two axes illustrated by nine analysis goals. It helps situate the analysis goals by placing each goal under axes of specificity (Explore, Describe, Explain, Confirm) and number of data populations (Single, Multiple). The single-population types are Discover Observation, Describe Observation, Identify Main Cause, and Collect Evidence. The multiple-population types are Compare Entities, Explain Differences, and Evaluate Hypothesis. Each analysis goal is scoped by an input and an output and is characterized by analysis steps reported in the design study papers. We provide examples of how we and others have used the framework in a top-down approach to abstracting domain problems: visualization designers or researchers first identify the analysis goals of each unit of analysis in an analysis stream, and then encode the individual steps using existing task classifications with the context of the goal, the level of specificity, and the number of populations involved in the analysis.},

  abstract = {We consider the problem of helping a decision maker (DM) choose from a set of multiattributed objects when her preferences are ``concavifiable,'' i.e. representable by a concave value function. We establish conditions under which preferences or preference intensities are concavifiable. We also derive a characterization for the family of concave value functions compatible with a set of such preference statements expressed by the DM. This can be used to validate dominance relations over discrete sets of alternatives and forms the basis of an interactive procedure. We report on the practical use of this procedure with several DMs for a flat-choice problem and its computational performance on a set of project-portfolio selection problem instances. The use of preference intensities is found to provide significant improvements to the performance of the procedure.},

  abstract = {Multicriteria conflict arises in pairwise comparisons, where each alternative outperforms the other one on some criterion, which imposes a trade-off. Comparing two alternatives can be difficult if their respective advantages are of high magnitude (the attribute spread is large). In this paper, we investigate to which extent conflict in a comparison situation can lead decision makers to express incomplete preferences, that is, to refuse to compare the two alternatives, or to be unable to compare them with confidence. We report on an experiment in which subjects expressed preferences on pairs of alternatives involving varying conflicts. Results show that depending on whether the participants are allowed to express incomplete preferences or not, attribute spread has a different effect: a large attribute spread increases the frequency of incomparability statements, when available, while it increases the use of indifference statements when only indifference and preference answers are permitted. These results lead us to derive some implications for preference elicitation methods involving comparison tasks.},

In order to obtain such an abstraction, we first examined six classes of workflows in data analysis and visualization, and identified four levels of typical visualization components, namely disseminative, observational, analytical and model-developmental visualization. We noticed a common phenomenon at different levels of visualization, that is, the transformation of data spaces (referred to as alphabets) usually corresponds to the reduction of maximal entropy along a workflow. Based on this observation, we establish an information-theoretic measure of cost-benefit ratio that may be used as a cost function for optimizing a data visualization process. To demonstrate the validity of this measure, we examined a number of successful visualization processes in the literature, and showed that the information-theoretic measure can mathematically explain the advantages of such processes over possible alternatives.},

  abstract = {We present a technique for converting a basic D3 chart into a reusable style template. Then, given a new data source we can apply the style template to generate a chart that depicts the new data, but in the style of the template. To construct the style template we first deconstruct the input D3 chart to recover its underlying structure: the data, the marks and the mappings that describe how the marks encode the data. We then rank the perceptual effectiveness of the deconstructed mappings. To apply the resulting style template to a new data source we first obtain importance ranks for each new data field. We then adjust the template mappings to depict the source data by matching the most important data fields to the most perceptually effective mappings. We show how the style templates can be applied to source data in the form of either a data table or another D3 chart. While our implementation focuses on generating templates for basic chart types (e.g., variants of bar charts, line charts, dot plots, scatterplots, etc.), these are the most commonly used chart types today. Users can easily find such basic D3 charts on the Web, turn them into templates, and immediately see how their own data would look in the visual style (e.g., colors, shapes, fonts, etc.) of the templates. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying a diverse set of style templates to a variety of source datasets.},

Designers face a number of design and implementation choices when using summarization in visual analytics systems. While these choices influence the utility of the resulting system, there are no clear guidelines for the use of these summarization techniques. In this paper, we codify summarization use in existing systems to identify key factors in the design of summary visualizations. We use quantitative content analysis to systematically survey examples of visual analytics systems and enumerate the use of these design factors in data summarization. Through this analysis, we expose the relationship between design considerations, strategies for data summarization in visualization systems, and how different summarization methods influence the analyses supported by systems. We use these results to synthesize common patterns in real-world use of summary visualizations and highlight open challenges and opportunities that these patterns offer for designing effective systems. This work provides a more principled understanding of design practices for summary visualization and offers insight into underutilized approaches.},

  title = {Representative {{Consensus}} from {{Limited}}-{{Size Ensembles}}},
  volume = {37},
  abstract = {Abstract Characterizing the uncertainty and extracting reliable visual information from ensemble data have been persistent challenges in various disciplines, specifically in simulation sciences. Many ensemble analysis and visualization techniques take a probabilistic approach to this problem with the assumption that the ensemble size is large enough to extract reliable statistical or probabilistic summaries. However, many real-life ensembles are rather limited in size, with only a handful of members, due to various restrictions such as storage, computational power, or sampling limitations. As a result, probabilistic inference is subject to imprecision and can potentially result in untrustworthy information in the presence of a limited sample-size ensemble. In this case, a more reliable approach is to fuse the information present in an ensemble with a limited number of members with minimal assumptions. In this paper, we propose a technique to construct a representative consensus that is particularly suited for ensembles of a relatively small size. The proposed technique casts the problem as an ordering problem in which at each point in the domain, the ensemble members are ranked based on the local neighborhood. This local approach allows us to provide shape and irregularity sensitivity. The local order statistics will then be fused to construct a global consensus using a Bayesian approach to ensure spatial coherency of the local information. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed technique using a synthetic and two real-life examples.},

  title = {On the {{Concept}} of {{Depth}} for {{Functional Data}}},
  volume = {104},
  abstract = {The statistical analysis of functional data is a growing need in many research areas. In particular, a robust methodology is important to study curves, which are the output of many experiments in applied statistics. As a starting point for this robust analysis, we propose, analyze, and apply a new definition of depth for functional observations based on the graphic representation of the curves. Given a collection of functions, it establishes the ``centrality'' of an observation and provides a natural center-outward ordering of the sample curves. Robust statistics, such as the median function or a trimmed mean function, can be defined from this depth definition. Its finite-dimensional version provides a new depth for multivariate data that is computationally feasible and useful for studying high-dimensional observations. Thus, this new depth is also suitable for complex observations such as microarray data, images, and those arising in some recent marketing and financial studies. Natural properties of these new concepts are established and the uniform consistency of the sample depth is proved. Simulation results show that the corresponding depth based trimmed mean presents better performance than other possible location estimators proposed in the literature for some contaminated models. Data depth can be also used to screen for outliers. The ability of the new notions of depth to detect ``shape'' outliers is presented. Several real datasets are considered to illustrate this new concept of depth, including applications to microarray observations, weather data, and growth curves. Finally, through this depth, we generalize to functions the Wilcoxon rank sum test. It allows testing whether two groups of curves come from the same population. This functional rank test when applied to children growth curves shows different growth patterns for boys and girls.},

This yields a trial-and-error process to verify the appropriate model and parameters. This paper contributes an exploratory interface that supports visual identification of low-dimensional structures in a high-dimensional dataset, and facilitates the optimized selection of data models and configurations. Our key idea is to abstract a set of global and local feature descriptors from the neighborhood graph-based representation of the latent low-dimensional structure, such as pairwise geodesic distance (GD) among points and pairwise local tangent space divergence (LTSD) among pointwise local tangent spaces (LTS). We propose a new LTSD-GD view, which is constructed by mapping LTSD and GD to the\$x\$axis and\$y\$axis using 1D multidimensional scaling, respectively. Unlike traditional dimensionality reduction methods that preserve various kinds of distances among points, the LTSD-GD view presents the distribution of pointwise LTS (\$x\$axis) and the variation of LTS in structures (the combination of\$x\$axis and\$y\$axis). We design and implement a suite of visual tools for navigating and reasoning about intrinsic structures of a high-dimensional dataset. Three case studies verify the effectiveness of our approach.},

Based on this discussion, we derive a number of open questions still waiting to be answered, thus formulating a research agenda for the use of abstraction for the visual representation and exploration of data.

These modules consist of two components: a software part and a lesson part. A computer program written in LISP-STAT with a highly interactive user interface that the instructor and the students can use for exploring various ideas and concepts comprises the software part. The lesson part is a prototype document providing guidance for instructors for creating their own lessons using the software module. This includes a description of concepts to be covered, instructions on how to use the module and some exercises. The regression modules described here are designed to illustrate various concepts associated with regression model fitting such as the use of residuals and other case diagnostics to check for model adequacy, the assessment of the effects of transforming the response variable on the regression fit using well-known diagnostic plots and the use of statistics to measure effects of collinearity on model selection.},

Visualization can support this process but, although there are many examples of systems for visual parameter analysis, there remains a need to systematically assess users' requirements and match those requirements to exemplar visualization methods. This article presents a new characterization of the requirements for pipeline design and optimization. This characterization is based on both a review of the literature and first-hand assessment of eight application case studies. We also match these requirements with exemplar functionality provided by existing visualization tools. Thus, we provide end-users and visualization developers with a way of identifying functionality that addresses data processing problems in an application. We also identify seven future challenges for visualization research that are not met by the capabilities of today's systems.},

Small multiples are great at showing pieces of data individually, however, they do not explain how the different pieces fit together. They can also be difficult to understand for unacquainted users. We propose an interactive technique which uses the paradigm of exploded views to make small multiples visualizations more intelligible for unacquainted users. An exploded view is a drawing in which the different components of the object are separated by distance in such a way that the relationship between these components becomes apparent and hidden components of the data are revealed. We use the exploded view paradigm to create various animation designs for multi-class data. The designs are then compared using the Elo ranking scheme. We hypothesize that the exploded view animations increase the ability of users to appreciate the relations among data clusters (in the compound view) and at the same time get a clearer idea about the features of the individual data clusters (in the exploded view). We conduct a user study to compare this interactive approach with a compound view and an animated small multiples visualization.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an approach for the interactive visualization, exploration and interpretation of large multivariate time series. Interesting patterns in such datasets usually appear as periodic or recurrent behavior often caused by the interaction between variables. To identify such patterns, we summarize the data as conceptual states, modeling temporal dynamics as transitions between the states. This representation can visualize large datasets with potentially billions of examples. We extend the representation to multiple spatial granularities allowing the user to find patterns on multiple scales. The result is an interactive web-based tool called StreamStory. StreamStory couples the abstraction with several tools that map the abstractions back to domain-specific concepts using techniques from statistics and machine learning. It is aimed at users who are not experts in data analytics, minimizing the number of parameters to configure out-of-the-box. We use three real-world datasets to demonstrate how StreamStory can be used to perform three main visual analytics tasks: identify the main states of a complex system and map them back to data-specific concepts, find high-level and long-term periodic behavior and traverse the scales to identify which scales exhibit interesting phenomena. We find and interpret several known, as well as previously unknown patterns in these datasets.},

  title = {Transformational {{Programming}}: {{Applications}} to {{Algorithms}} and {{Systems}}},
  isbn = {978-0-89791-090-3},
  shorttitle = {Transformational {{Programming}}},
  abstract = {Ten years ago Cheatham and Wegbreit [4] proposed a
transformational program development methodology based on notions
of top-down stepwise program refinement first expressed by Dijkstra
[10] and Wirth [45]. A schema describing the process of this
methodology is given in fig. 1. To develop a program by
transformation, we first specify the program in as high a level of
abstraction and as great a degree of clarity as our programming
language admits. This high level problem statement program P is
proved correct semimechanically according to some standard approach
(see Flovd and Hoare [15, 21]), Next, using an interactive system
equipped with a library of encoded transformations, each of which
maps a correct program into another equivalent program, we select
and apply transformations one at a time to successive versions of
the program until we obtain a concrete, low level, effecient
implementation version P'. The goals of transformational
programming are to reduce programming labor, improve program
reliability, and upgrade program performance. In order for labor to
be reduced, the effort required to obtain P, prove it correct, and
derive P' by transformation should be less than the effort required
to code P from scratch, and also to debug it. Program reliability
will be improved if P can be certified correct, and if each
transformation preserves program meaning. Finally, program
performance will be upgraded if transformations are directed
towards increased efficiency.
Experimental transformational systems that emphasize one or more
aspects of the methodology outlined above have been implemented by
Cheatham [5], Darlington [3], Loveman [27], Standish [41], Feather
[14] Huet and Lang [11], and others. However, all of these systems
fall short of the goals, because of a number of reasons that
include,
1 inability to mechanize the checking of transformation
applicability conditions
2 reliance on large, unmanageable collections of low level
transformations, and long arduous derivation sequences
3 dependency on transformations whose potential for improving
program performance is unpredictable
4 use of source languages insufficiently high level to
accommodate perspicuous initial program specifications and powerful
algorithmic transformations
Yet, convincing evidence that this new methodology will succeed
has come from recent advances in verification, program
transformations, syntax directed editting systems, and high level
languages. These advances, discussed below, represent partial
solution to the problems stated above, and could eventually be
integrated into a single system
1 The transformational approach to verification was pioneered by
Gerhart [19] and strengthened by the results of Schwartz [39],
Scherlis [36], Broy et al [2], Koenig and Paige [26.31] Blaustein
[1], and others. Due mainly to improved technology for the
mechanization of proofs of enabling conditions that justify
application of transformations, this approach is now at a point
where it can be effectively used in a system. Such mechanization
depends strongly on program analysis, and, in particular, on
reanalyses after a program is modified. Attribute grammars [24]
have been shown to be especially useful in facilitating program
analysis [23]. Moreover, Reps [34] has discovered algorithm that
reevaluates attributes in optimal time after a program undergoes
syntax directed editing changes (as are allowed on the Cornell
Synthesizer [43]). He has implemented his algorithm recently, and
has reported initial success
2 There are encouraging indications that a transformational
system can be made to depend mainly on a small but powerful
collection of transformations applied top-down fashion to programs
specified at various levels of abstraction from logic down to
assembler. We envision such a system as a fairly conventional
semiautomatic compiler which classes of transformations are
selected semimechanically in a predetermined order, and are
justified by predicates supplied mechanically but proved
semimanually. Of particular importance is nondeterminism removal
which has formulated by Sharir [40] could lead to a technique for
turning naive, nondeterministic programs into deterministic
programs with emergent strategies. Such programs could then be
transformed automatically by finite differencing [13, 16, 17, 18,
29, 30, 31] and jamming [28, 31, 20] (which we have implemented)
into programs whose data access paths are fully determined. The
SETL optimizer could improve these programs further by
automatically choosing efficient data structure representations and
aggregations
3 Of fundamental importance to the transformations just
mentioned is the fact that they can be associated with speedup
predictions Fong and Ullman [16] were the first to characterize an
important class of algorithmic differencing transformations in
terms of accurate asymptotic speedup predictions, eg, they gave
conditions under which repeated calculation of a set former \{x in
s|k(x)\} could be computed on O(\#s) + cost(k) steps. By considering
stronger conditions and special cases for the boolean valued
subpart k, Paige [31] later gave sharper speedup predictions (eg,
either O(1) steps for each encounter of the set former or a
cumulative cost of O(\#s) steps for every encounter) associated with
another differencing method. Both Morgenstern [28] and Paige [31]
prove constant factor improvements due to their jamming
transformations (implemented by Morgenstern for the improvement of
file processing, and by Paige for the optimization of programs).
Constant factor speedup has also been observed for data structure
selection by the method of basings but a supporting analytic study
has not been presented [8, 37]
4 Essential to the whole transformational process is a wide
spectrum programming language (or set of languages) that can
express a program at every stage of development from the initial
abstract specification down to its concrete implementation
realization. Since transformations applied to programs written at
the highest levels of abstraction are likely to make the most
fundamental algorithmic changes, it is important to stress abstract
features in our language. In addition to supporting
transformations, the highest level language dictions should support
lucid initial specifications, verification, and even program
analysts. Of special importance is SETL [38, 9], because its
abstract set theoretic dictions can model data structures and
algorithms easily, because its philosophy of avoiding hidden a
symptotic costs facilitates program analysis, because its semantics
conforms to finite set theory and can accommodate a set theoretic
program logic, and because it is wide spectrum. As is evidenced by
the work of Schwartz, Fong, Paige, and Sharir, SETL is also a rich
medium for transformation.},

  abstract = {The exact area calculation of irregularly distributed data is in the focus of all territorial geochemical balancing methods or definition of protection zones. Especially in the deep-sea environment the interpolation of measurements into surfaces represents an important gain of information, because of cost- and time-intensive data acquisition. The geostatistical interpolation method indicator kriging therefore is applied for an accurate mapping of the spatial distribution of benthic communities following a categorical classification scheme at the deep-sea submarine H{\aa}kon Mosby Mud Volcano. Georeferenced video mosaics were obtained during several dives by the Remotely Operated Vehicle Victor6000 in a water depth of 1260 m. Mud volcanoes are considered as significant source locations for methane indicated by unique chemoautotrophic communities as Beggiatoa mats and pogonophoran tube worms. For the detection and quantification of their spatial distribution 2840 georeferenced video mosaics were analysed by visual inspection. Polygons, digitised on the georeferenced images within a GIS, build the data basis for geostatistically interpolated mono-parametric surface maps. Indicator kriging is applied to the centroids of the polygons calculating surface maps. The quality assessment of the surface maps is conducted by leave-one-out cross-validation evaluating the fit of the indicator kriging variograms by using statistical mean values. Furthermore, the estimate was evaluated by a validation dataset of the visual inspection of 530 video mosaics not included within the interpolation, thus, proving the interpolated surfaces independently. With regard to both validating mechanisms, we attained satisfying results and we provided each category applied for the identification of biogeochemical habitats with a percentage probability value of occurrence. \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

  shorttitle = {Decision Making with Visualizations},
  abstract = {Visualizations\textemdash{}visual representations of information, depicted in graphics\textemdash{}are studied by researchers in numerous ways, ranging from the study of the basic principles of creating visualizations, to the cognitive processes underlying their use, as well as how visualizations communicate complex information (such as in medical risk or spatial patterns). However, findings from different domains are rarely shared across domains though there may be domain-general principles underlying visualizations and their use. The limited cross-domain communication may be due to a lack of a unifying cognitive framework. This review aims to address this gap by proposing an integrative model that is grounded in models of visualization comprehension and a dual-process account of decision making. We review empirical studies of decision making with static two-dimensional visualizations motivated by a wide range of research goals and find significant direct and indirect support for a dual-process account of decision making with visualizations. Consistent with a dual-process model, the first type of visualization decision mechanism produces fast, easy, and computationally light decisions with visualizations. The second facilitates slower, more contemplative, and effortful decisions with visualizations. We illustrate the utility of a dual-process account of decision making with visualizations using four cross-domain findings that may constitute universal visualization principles. Further, we offer guidance for future research, including novel areas of exploration and practical recommendations for visualization designers based on cognitive theory and empirical findings.},

  shorttitle = {Bayesian {{History Matching}} of {{Complex Infectious Disease Models Using Emulation}}},
  abstract = {Advances in scientific computing have allowed the development of complex models that are being routinely applied to problems in disease epidemiology, public health and decision making. The utility of these models depends in part on how well they can reproduce empirical data. However, fitting such models to real world data is greatly hindered both by large numbers of input and output parameters, and by long run times, such that many modelling studies lack a formal calibration methodology. We present a novel method that has the potential to improve the calibration of complex infectious disease models (hereafter called simulators). We present this in the form of a tutorial and a case study where we history match a dynamic, event-driven, individual-based stochastic HIV simulator, using extensive demographic, behavioural and epidemiological data available from Uganda. The tutorial describes history matching and emulation. History matching is an iterative procedure that reduces the simulator's input space by identifying and discarding areas that are unlikely to provide a good match to the empirical data. History matching relies on the computational efficiency of a Bayesian representation of the simulator, known as an emulator. Emulators mimic the simulator's behaviour, but are often several orders of magnitude faster to evaluate. In the case study, we use a 22 input simulator, fitting its 18 outputs simultaneously. After 9 iterations of history matching, a non-implausible region of the simulator input space was identified that was times smaller than the original input space. Simulator evaluations made within this region were found to have a 65\% probability of fitting all 18 outputs. History matching and emulation are useful additions to the toolbox of infectious disease modellers. Further research is required to explicitly address the stochastic nature of the simulator as well as to account for correlations between outputs.},

  abstract = {Labeling data instances is an important task in machine learning and visual analytics. Both fields provide a broad set of labeling strategies, whereby machine learning (and in particular active learning) follows a rather model-centered approach and visual analytics employs rather user-centered approaches (visual-interactive labeling). Both approaches have individual strengths and weaknesses. In this work, we conduct an experiment with three parts to assess and compare the performance of these different labeling strategies. In our study, we (1) identify different visual labeling strategies for user-centered labeling, (2) investigate strengths and weaknesses of labeling strategies for different labeling tasks and task complexities, and (3) shed light on the effect of using different visual encodings to guide the visual-interactive labeling process. We further compare labeling of single versus multiple instances at a time, and quantify the impact on efficiency. We systematically compare the performance of visual interactive labeling with that of active learning. Our main findings are that visual-interactive labeling can outperform active learning, given the condition that dimension reduction separates well the class distributions. Moreover, using dimension reduction in combination with additional visual encodings that expose the internal state of the learning model turns out to improve the performance of visual-interactive labeling.},

  abstract = {We explore how to rigorously evaluate multidimensional visualizations for their ability to support decision making. We first define multi-attribute choice tasks, a type of decision task commonly performed with such visualizations. We then identify which of the existing multidimensional visualizations are compatible with such tasks, and set out to evaluate three elementary visualizations: parallel coordinates, scatterplot matrices and tabular visualizations. Our method consists in first giving participants low-level analytic tasks, in order to ensure that they properly understood the visualizations and their interactions. Participants are then given multi-attribute choice tasks consisting of choosing holiday packages. We assess decision support through multiple objective and subjective metrics, including a decision accuracy metric based on the consistency between the choice made and self-reported preferences for attributes. We found the three visualizations to be comparable on most metrics, with a slight advantage for tabular visualizations. In particular, tabular visualizations allow participants to reach decisions faster. Thus, although decision time is typically not central in assessing decision support, it can be used as a tie-breaker when visualizations achieve similar decision accuracy. Our results also suggest that indirect methods for assessing choice confidence may allow to better distinguish between visualizations than direct ones. We finally discuss the limitations of our methods and directions for future work, such as the need for more sensitive metrics of decision support.},

We found that the developers have two different methods for understanding the output, numerical and visual, depending on their background. We designed cellPACKexplorer with a flexible interface to support both types of users. We evaluated our tool through case studies and questionnaires. Novice users were able to create cell models with cellPACK and explore the behavior of different parameters. Further, expert users discovered an error in the code and were able to locate the problem quickly with our new analysis tool. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of our findings in the wider visualization community.},
