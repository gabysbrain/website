# About me

![](/images/me.jpg)

I am a Postdoctoral researcher at VRVis.  I study
how visualization and statistical methods can be used to help scientists
understand and create better computer models.

I try to spend as much time in the outdoors as possible. I love skiing,
hiking, climbing, and scuba diving.  I have also been known to run or bike
occasionally.

My email address is [torsney-weir@vrvis.at](mailto:torsney-weir@vrvis.at)

I can also be found
as "gabysbrain" on
[Github](https://github.com/gabysbrain)
