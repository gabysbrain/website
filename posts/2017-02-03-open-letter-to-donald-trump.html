  <section>
    <p>Dear Mr. Trump,</p>
<p>I am writing to you in hopes that this will generate some momentum to force you to step down as president. I actually considered voting for you at one point during your campaign. Your promise to clean out the Washington establishment resonated with me. I am no fan of the lobbying/re-election driven people in the government. In my opinion, the government should support the people and not be influenced by corporations. Without this separation what is to stop companies from exploiting the citizens?</p>
<p>However, the more I thought about you as a person I realized you would be a terrible president. You’ve flaunted the laws for your own personal gain as you have done with bankruptcy law. You seemed to only act to better yourself at the expense of anyone who invested with you. Nevertheless, when you were elected I held on to a glimmer of hope that you would indeed change the government for the better.</p>
<p>Rather than remove the lobbyists and reduce corporate influence in Washington, you have enhanced it. Through your actions you have tied your business interests to the government. You have stepped over the middlemen lobbyists and directly hired other buisiness leaders. You have refused to fully divest yourself from your business interests. Rather than stepping down fully, you’ve given control to your son-in-law. I assume this was the legal miniumum required to become president. By not releasing your tax returns, it will be more difficult to expose you for the fraud you are.</p>
<p>You are the leader of one of the greatest, most powerful countries in the world. You have the power to do so much good in the world. You have the power to push policies to have safe health care, end wars, or protect the Earth. Instead, you are squandering this opportunity and making you and your friends slightly richer. You have shamed what it means to be an American citizen. I am ashamed now to call myself an American and you should be too.</p>
<p>Sincerely, Thomas Torsney-Weir</p>
