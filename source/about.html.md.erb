# About me

<p>

</p>

I am a PhD student at the University of Vienna in Austria.  I study how
visualization and statistical methods can be used to help scientists
understand and create better computer models.

I try to spend as much time in the outdoors as possible. I love skiing,
hiking, climbing, and scuba diving.  I have also been known to run or bike
occasionally.

My email address is [thomas.torsney-weir@univie.ac.at](<%= email_url %>).

I can also be found
as "gabysbrain" on
[Github](<%= github_url %>),
[Twitter](<%= twitter_url %>), and
[foursquare](<%= foursquare_url %>).

My work address is:
