We present an approach to optimizing a high-dimensional scalar function that
systematically explores the parameter space. Our core idea is the following
two-stage technique: We start with a sparse sampling of the parameter space
and apply a statistical model to estimate the response of the segmentation
algorithm. The statistical model incorporates a model of uncertainty of the
estimation which we use in conjunction with the actual estimate in (visually)
guiding the user towards areas that need refinement by placing additional
sample points. In the second stage the user navigates through the parameter
space in order to determine areas where the response value is high.
