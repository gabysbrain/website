title: Learning what I can do in a day

I've been using [Things](http://culturedcode.com/things/) and now
[Asana](http://www.asana.com) for task management for over a year now. What is
great about these tools is I can set due dates for all my tasks and they
magically appear on that day to remind me to do that.  I rely on the today
view both these tools have to tell me what needs to be done that day as well
as the upcoming task view to tell me what the next few days are like.
However, I found that I wasn't being careful about when I was scheduling
tasks. Because of that I was over-scheduling my days. I would load up the
upcoming days with a set of tasks that I couldn't possibly finish.  This was
especially true for the weekends where I'd arbitrarily schedule personal tasks
for the weekend and come Saturday find I had 17 things to do.

What, sadly, took me a long time to realize was that no matter how much
technological support I have to get tasks done, task-management isn't just
enumerating everything you need to get done and then doing them.
I still need to carefully plan when I'm going to get stuff done.

## Mindful scheduling

What this means is that I need to look at my calendar while I'm planning due
dates.  Asana will publish your tasks as a calendar and I can see what I have
already scheduled for the next week or month or so.  With that I can decide on
due dates around appropriately.  The other nice thing about this is that I
used to plan tasks without considering things like meetings, parties, and
such. All these things really take a toll on my productivity.  I know that
meetings take a lot of time so I won't be able to get much done that day.
Furthermore, if I only have an hour in between meetings I can't get actual
research work done.  It simply takes me more than an hour to get up and
running with serious intellectual tasks.  What I can schedule in that time are
quick, relatively mindless things like filling in forms and cleaning.

Another thing I try to be conscious of giving myself at least one "get up
and running task" on days when I know it's going to be difficult to get
working.  Usually these are Mondays or days after parties.  In the morning
I'll start with something relatively mindless and easy like filling out a form that I know I can
finish.  This gets me into the mindset of working and then I can do
more complex tasks next.

## Proper timing

The extension of this is that I need to carefully consider how long each
task will take.  With this I really try to be realistic and not 
underestimate the time needed.  In fact, I usually try and over-estimate.
I rarely finish anything early and even if I do there's always plenty 
more things for me to do.

One of the issues I've always had with fitting my research
tasks into any task management system is that tasks like, "learn about
exemplar SVMs," can take several days of reading and research and don't
have a clearly defined end.  With these I basically give myself two 
or three days to finish.  After that I re-evaluate where I am and often
I find that the task has branched off into several other tasks.  I mark the original task done and create the new ones.

The final thing is that since I rely so much on the today view, if I don't get
something done on the day it's due then I don't leave it.  I reschedule it.
Otherwise I have to overload a day just to stay ahead.  It's better to figure
out exactly when I can now finish this item rather than having a long list of
things not done.  Asana has a nice change tracking feature so in theory I can
see which items I postponed.

## Discipline!

The overall effect of keeping disciplined about all this is that I'm actually
able to make progress on everything.  Plus my deadlines are based on my
current workload, not just some random guess so I'm able to give everyone 
realistic deadlines.  Being realistic with myself about my workload and
how long things take to get done mean that I actually get more done.
