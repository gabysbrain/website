h1 Sensitivity analysis reading group

p
  | The goal of this reading group is to learn what sensitivity analysis is,
    how it differs from uncertainty analysis, and how we can use visualization
    of uncertainty to help better analyze simulation models.

p
  | We will meet to discuss on Tuesdays at 4pm CET/8am MST for one hour. The
    meeting will start with a 10 minute overview of the paper by the presenter
    followed by a discussion for the remaining time. Ideally, the presenter
    should send out the slides the night before to everyone to prepare
    questions/comments.
