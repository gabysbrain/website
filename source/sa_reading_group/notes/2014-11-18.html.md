title: Vis 2014 recap
---

## Vis observations

* infovis is larger than scivis again both in attendees and researchers
* infovis seems younger overall
* scivis presentation style is completely different from infovis
* not much on uncertainty even in scivis (just dan keefe, ross whitaker)
* infovis seems to be starting to move to using models rather 
  than just abstract data

## Follow-ups

* look at the definitions of SA and UQ in the Saltelli and Cacuci books
    * categorize the differences between them
* TTW will try to find a third source of definitions
