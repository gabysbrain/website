title: Sensitivity analysis in practice, chapter 1 notes
---

## Logistics

* In 4 weeks we will review the notes from the UQ workshop
* Maybe in november switch to 90 minute meetings

### Further readings
* Maybe read ch 2 and ch 8 which is famous quotes - relation to real world
* Ch 6 - relation to uncertainty and bayes
* Ch 3 - examples
* October is saltelli month and nov is the next book
* For ch 8 Tom should find presos from pitfalls by saltelli
  he's given elsewhere
* Ch 2 on 14 and ch 3 after that (put up chapters)

## Sensitivity analysis in practice, chapter 1

### Overall opinions

* Easy to understand
* Difficulty between expectation of variance and variance of expectation
* Used to seeing the cs as the dial and analyzing the sensitivity of the
  random variables is weird
* Buildup of sens techniques was very nice
* Connection to regression analysis was also good and interesting
* Wanted visualization of multi-dimensional space when doing global
  sens measures
    * Visualize slices of the space

### Analysis tasks

* Vis cares about data and tasks
    * Task in portfolio analysis is never made explicit
    * actual task: He's building a model and wants to know which
      variables matter most
    * There are grounds to local sens that are part of a different task:
      how does portfolio change over time?
* Vis done outside the community also has a lot of different
  assumptions - vis in the wild
* Need to appreciate the kinds of questions that are being asked
  inside the community and outside

### Global vs local

* Interesting that Satelli assumes people gravitate towards local sens
* Local sens = derivative and more intuitive
* Global sens is harder to interpret and compute
* Probabilistic interpretation is not taught as much or emphasized
* e.g. Physics: causal relationship is ingrained in people's minds. Adapting
  to probabilistic interpretation is hard

### Interpretation of total effect

* Why is total effect necessary and sufficient but not the main effect for
  $P_s = 0$ to not be influential
* If all params are fixed then this one is also fixed
* If $P_s = 0$ then there is a simpler model to express the model
  without $P_s$

## Finance

* Now we have access to the order book so lack of knowledge of the state of
  the market is no decreasing
* High freq systems are becoming less and less of an exploit as lag in
  network communication becomes less
* e.g. Environmental factors: orange furures are dictated by weather

## Interpretations of uncertainty

* Is uncertainty may be defined by many/some people as models that
  have a nonlinear response?
* as epistemic uncertainty goes to 0 only aleatoric is left
* saltelli defines simple model as linear and orthogonal

## How people analyze models

* Working with params people either want to orthogonalize the space or take
  into account the correlations
* One application is to do dimension reduction
* Challenge with pca is getting sensical parameters

## Followups

* Tom should write out a statement to describe more about these fiscal
  models to ask what makes sense for financial models. Factors, etc.  how
  do people look at these models? What does intuition tell people to look at
* chapter 2 should be exciting!
