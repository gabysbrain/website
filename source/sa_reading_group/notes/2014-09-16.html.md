## UQ workshop

* Integrating terminologies into UQ
* generation -> quantification/visualization -> decision (+ cog sci stuff)
* hurricane tracking is a success story climate modeling coming soon
* climate modelers didn't take into account human factors
  (just internal scientific discussion)

## Logistics

* what are the nuances between SA vs UQ
* MK will summarize first volume of the book and group will discuss vol 2
  intro chapter. (4 weeks)
* 2004 paper for next week and see how definitions change (2 weeks)

## SA as an ingredient in modeling

* usages of terms fit naturally with UQ literature
  * global first then local
* sobol indices are quite popular in UQ field
* FAST is more common on the stats side
* Fisher model is the old stats model at universities (started applied)
* now stats fields are very pure (these depts are changing back to applied)

### perceptions of UQ

* in UQ things were historically expressed probabilistically
* uncertain data -> add distribution model as proxy

* scientists sometimes think that UQ is one single method
  * is it an all or nothing operation?
  * UQ is actually a toolbox and needs external question to drive selections

### reasons more people don't use SA methods?

* modellers lag behind analysts
* there is ignorance of what tools are available in vis and UQ
  * this is because we don't properly communicate these techniques
* is it from overconfidence(think they can do better) or
  educational deficiency(don't know about methods)?
* the issue may be because model analysis is not taught
  in a case-study fashion
* talk about broad usage and more practical examples rather than theory
* similar to vis where many techniques but people don't know all of them

### computational problem solving (aka problem-driven)

* start with problem
* then introduce techniques to solve it
* don't just introduce techniques and then give applications

## follow-ups

* what do we think about the statement on page 394?
* main vs total effects
* precise vs colloquial usages of terms, esp variance
  * variance vs uncertainty
* how to do groupings of the input factors? and sensitivity to that grouping
